# Example: 24-Month Strategic Stockpile Building Plan

€100/month budget, The Netherlands-focused, Inflation-optimized.

In as little as 2 to 10 years, you could earn at least a €1,000 to €3,000 euro's by dodging inflation and smart buying, and following this guide.

## 10-YEAR SAVINGS

| Period | Spent | Saved | Net Benefit |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Years 1-2 (Build phase) | €2,400 | €3,074 | +€674 |
| Years 3-10 (Maintenance) | €3,840 | €4,080 | +€240 |
| 10-YEAR TOTAL | €6,240 | €7,154 | +€914 |

I also included investment options, as investing yields even more (index fund)

## Overview Strategy

- Months 1-6: Core essentials (food, water, hygiene)
- Months 7-12: Expand categories (health, tools, household)
- Months 13-18: Depth + seasonal items
- Months 19-24: Specialty items + top-offs

Key principles:
- Buy when on sale (Albert Heijn Bonus, Action deals, Kruidvat promotions)
- Prioritize long shelf-life items first
- Focus on items with highest inflation risk
- Rotate stock as you buy (use oldest first)

## Shopping Strategy Tips for Netherlands

### Best Stores by Category

Budget staples:
- Action: Cleaning, tools, batteries, office, household
- Lidl/Aldi: Food, seasonal items
- Zeeman: Clothing, textiles

Bulk buying:
- Makro/Sligro: Requires business card (or find someone with one)
- Toko stores: Asian goods, rice, spices in bulk

Health/hygiene:
- Kruidvat: Toiletries, OTC meds (best deals with loyalty card)
- Etos: Alternative to Kruidvat

Hardware:
- Gamma/Praxis: Tools, home improvement
- Bouwmaat: Trade supplies (good bulk prices)

### Timing Your Purchases

- January: Post-holiday clearance, winter gear
- March-April: Spring cleaning products on sale
- July-August: Summer clearance, back-to-school
- September: Fall prep, canning supplies
- November: Black Friday/Singles Day deals online
- December: Post-Christmas clearance

### Money-Saving Tactics

1. Loyalty cards: Kruidvat, Albert Heijn Bonus Card, Jumbo Extras
2. Apps: Scoupy, Too Good To Go (food waste), Marktplaats (bulk deals)
3. Weekly flyers: Check Alle Folders app for current sales
4. Buy generic: Huismerk products are 20-40% cheaper
5. Price per kg/L: Always compare unit prices, not package prices

---

## Storage Plan

### Where to Store

- Dry pantry: Rice, pasta, canned goods, spices
- Cool closet: Batteries, electronics, paper goods
- Under bed: Toilet paper, paper towels (in bins)
- Garage/shed: Tools, seasonal items, bulk liquids
- Kitchen cabinets: Overflow food, cooking supplies
- Bathroom cabinet: Health/hygiene overflow

### Organization System

1. Label everything: Purchase date, expiration date
2. FIFO rotation: First In, First Out - use oldest first
3. Category bins: Group similar items together
4. Inventory spreadsheet: Track what you have, when to replace
5. Monthly check: Review for expired items, reorder needs

---

## Adjustment Options

If you have extra money some months:
- Double up on Month 1-6 essentials
- Buy more expensive items (quality tools, cast iron)
- Stock up during major sales

If you need to cut budget:
- Reduce quantities by 30-40%
- Focus on Months 1-12 only
- Skip pet/specialty categories

If certain items are unavailable:
- Substitute similar products
- Use online shopping (Bol.com, Coolblue)
- Check Marktplaats for bulk deals

---

## After 24 Months: Maintenance Mode

Once your stockpile is built, switch to:

€30-50/month maintenance:
- Replace items as you use them
- Rotate expiring food
- Top off depleted categories

Invest the remaining €50-70:
- Index funds (VWRL on DeGiro)
- Emergency cash fund
- Home improvements that reduce costs

---

# Total Savings Calculation: 24-Month Stockpile Plan

Let me break down all the actual savings from this strategic buying plan.

---

## Base Investment

- Total spent: €100/month × 24 months = €2,400

---

## SAVINGS BREAKDOWN

### 1. Inflation Savings (€2,400 spent over 24 months)

Since you're buying throughout the 2-year period, items bought early save more than items bought late.

| When Purchased | Inflation Avoided | Savings on €1,200 Annual Budget |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Months 1-6 | ~22% over remaining 10 years | €264 |
| Months 7-12 | ~20% over remaining 9.5 years | €240 |
| Months 13-18 | ~18% over remaining 9 years | €216 |
| Months 19-24 | ~16% over remaining 8.5 years | €192 |

Total inflation savings: ~€912 over the 10-year period

---

### 2. Bulk Buying Discounts

Buying larger quantities almost always reduces unit cost:

- Toilet paper: 20-30% cheaper per roll in bulk
- Rice/pasta: 30-40% cheaper buying 10kg vs 1kg packages
- Cleaning supplies: 25% cheaper in multi-packs
- Batteries: 40-50% cheaper in bulk packs
- Canned goods: 15-20% cheaper buying cases

Conservative estimate: 15% average savings on bulk purchases
- 15% of €2,400 = €360 saved

---

### 3. Sale/Promotion Buying

By timing purchases with sales (Bonus Week at AH, Action deals, Kruidvat 1+1 gratis):

- Average discount when buying on sale: 25-40%
- Estimate: 50% of purchases made during sales
- Average savings: 30% on half of purchases

Calculation:
- 30% × 50% × €2,400 = €360 saved

---

### 4. Avoided Emergency Shopping

Premium paid for last-minute purchases:

- Convenience stores: 30-50% markup
- Late-night pharmacies: 20-30% markup
- Airport/train station shops: 100%+ markup
- Panic buying during shortages: 50-200% markup

Conservative estimate:
- Avoiding 30 emergency trips over 2 years
- Average €10 extra cost per emergency trip
- €300 saved

---

### 5. Store Brand vs Name Brand

The plan prioritizes huismerk (store brands) which are typically:
- 20-40% cheaper than name brands
- Often identical quality (same manufacturer)

If 60% of purchases are store brand alternatives:
- Average 30% savings on those items
- 30% × 60% × €2,400 = €432 saved

---

### 6. Avoided Waste

Having supplies prevents waste from:
- Spoiled food (always have staples for meals)
- Over-ordering takeout when pantry seems empty
- Buying duplicates because you can't find items

Conservative estimate:
- €15/month in prevented waste/duplicates
- €15 × 24 months = €360 saved

---

### 7. No Delivery Fees

With stocked supplies, fewer emergency orders:
- Jumbo delivery: €4-7 per order
- Bol.com: €3.99 per order under €20
- Food delivery apps: €2-5 per order

Estimate:
- Avoiding 40 delivery orders over 2 years
- Average €5 per delivery
- €200 saved

---

### 8. Price Lock on Rising Categories

Certain categories in Netherlands seeing above-average inflation:

- Toilet paper: +15-20% over 2 years
- Coffee: +25-30% over 2 years  
- Cleaning products: +12-18% over 2 years
- Canned goods: +10-15% over 2 years

By buying early, you lock in lower prices on high-inflation items.

Additional savings beyond base inflation: ~€150

---

## TOTAL SAVINGS: Years 1-2

| Savings Category | Amount |
|------------------|--------|
| Inflation protection | €912 |
| Bulk buying discounts | €360 |
| Sale shopping | €360 |
| Avoided emergency premiums | €300 |
| Store brand substitution | €432 |
| Prevented waste | €360 |
| No delivery fees | €200 |
| Price lock on high-inflation items | €150 |
| TOTAL SAVINGS | €3,074 |

---

## LONG-TERM SAVINGS: Years 3-10

After your initial 24-month build, you maintain the stockpile:

Maintenance phase (€40/month average):
- Replacing consumed items
- Rotating expiring goods
- €40 × 12 months × 8 years = €3,840 additional spending

Continued savings in Years 3-10:
- Inflation protection: Items bought in Years 1-2 continue saving you money
- Bulk buying continues: €180/year × 8 years = €1,440
- Sale shopping continues: €180/year × 8 years = €1,440
- Avoided emergencies: €150/year × 8 years = €1,200

## OPPORTUNITY COST: What You Give Up

### Investment Alternative

If you invested €100/month instead of stockpiling:

Scenario: Index fund (VWRL via DeGiro)
- Monthly investment: €100
- Period: 24 months + €40 maintenance for 96 months
- Average return: 7% annually
- Final value after 10 years: ~€17,500
- Your contribution: €6,240
- Investment gains: ~€11,260

### Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

Years 1-2: Build stockpile aggressively
- €100/month - stockpiling
- Total: €2,400 invested in supplies
- Savings: €3,074

Years 3-10: Maintenance + Investing
- €40/month - maintain stockpile (€3,840 total)
- €60/month - invest in index funds (€5,760 invested)

Investment calculation (96 months at €60/month):
- Starting month 25, invest €60/month
- 7% annual return
- Final investment value: ~€8,900
- Your contribution: €5,760
- Investment gains: ~€3,140
