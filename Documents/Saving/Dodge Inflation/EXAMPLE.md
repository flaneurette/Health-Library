# 24-Month Strategic Stockpile Building Plan

€100/month budget, Netherlands-focused, Inflation-optimized.

In 10 years time, inflation can rise to about 25%. In short: buying early could give you 25% discount.

In as little as 2 to 10 years, you could save €900 to €7,000 by dodging inflation through smart buying and following this guide.

---

## THREE STRATEGIES COMPARED

All strategies use the same €12,000 total budget over 10 years:

| Strategy | How It Works | Net Profit | What You Get |
|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| All Investment | €100/month into index funds for 10 years | €5,300 | Maximum returns, no stockpile |
| All Stockpile | €100/month on supplies for 2 years, then €40/month maintenance | €914 | Full security, modest profit |
| Hybrid    | Build stockpile (2 years), then maintain + invest (8 years) | €4,054 | Strong profit + full stockpile |

### Recommended: Hybrid Approach

Years 1-2: €100/month builds complete 6-12 month stockpile
Years 3-10: €40/month maintenance + €60/month investing

Why it wins:
- 76% of maximum investment returns (only €1,246 less)
- Complete emergency preparedness
- Real total value: ~€11,000 (including time savings & crisis protection)

---

## STOCKPILE-ONLY APPROACH: 10-YEAR SAVINGS

If you just want to focus on stockpiling without investing:

| Period | Spent | Saved | Net Benefit |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Years 1-2 (Build phase) | €2,400 | €3,074 | +€674 |
| Years 3-10 (Maintenance) | €3,840 | €4,080 | +€240 |
| 10-YEAR TOTAL | €6,240 | €7,154 | +€914 |

### Where the Savings Come From (Years 1-2)

| Savings Source | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Inflation protection (early buying) | €912 |
| Bulk buying discounts (15% avg) | €360 |
| Sale shopping (30% on 50% of purchases) | €360 |
| Avoided emergency shopping premiums | €300 |
| Store brand substitution | €432 |
| Prevented waste/duplicates | €360 |
| No delivery fees | €200 |
| Price lock on high-inflation items | €150 |
| Total Years 1-2 Savings | €3,074 |

### Continued Savings (Years 3-10)

When maintaining your stockpile at €40/month:
- Bulk buying continues: €180/year
- Sale shopping continues: €180/year  
- Avoided emergencies: €150/year
- Other ongoing savings: €200/year

Total: €712/year × 8 years = €4,080

Key principles:
- Buy when on sale (Albert Heijn Bonus, Action deals, Kruidvat promotions)

## Shopping Strategy Tips for Netherlands

### Best Stores by Category

Budget staples:
- Action: Cleaning, tools, batteries, office, household
- Lidl/Aldi: Food, seasonal items
- Zeeman: Clothing, textiles

Bulk buying:
- Makro/Sligro: Requires business card (or find someone with one)
- Toko stores: Asian goods, rice, spices in bulk

Health/hygiene:
- Kruidvat: Toiletries, OTC meds (best deals with loyalty card)
- Etos: Alternative to Kruidvat

Hardware:
- Gamma/Praxis: Tools, home improvement
- Bouwmaat: Trade supplies (good bulk prices)

### Timing Your Purchases

- January: Post-holiday clearance, winter gear
- March-April: Spring cleaning products on sale
- July-August: Summer clearance, back-to-school
- September: Fall prep, canning supplies
- November: Black Friday/Singles Day deals online
- December: Post-Christmas clearance

### Money-Saving Tactics

1. Loyalty cards: Kruidvat, Albert Heijn Bonus Card, Jumbo Extras
2. Apps: Scoupy, Too Good To Go (food waste), Marktplaats (bulk deals)
3. Weekly flyers: Check Alle Folders app for current sales
4. Buy generic: Huismerk products are 20-40% cheaper
5. Price per kg/L: Always compare unit prices, not package prices

---

## Storage Plan

### Where to Store

- Dry pantry: Rice, pasta, canned goods, spices
- Cool closet: Batteries, electronics, paper goods
- Under bed: Toilet paper, paper towels (in bins)
- Garage/shed: Tools, seasonal items, bulk liquids
- Kitchen cabinets: Overflow food, cooking supplies
- Bathroom cabinet: Health/hygiene overflow

### Organization System

1. Label everything: Purchase date, expiration date
2. FIFO rotation: First In, First Out - use oldest first
3. Category bins: Group similar items together
4. Inventory spreadsheet: Track what you have, when to replace
5. Monthly check: Review for expired items, reorder needs

---

## Adjustment Options

If you have extra money some months:
- Double up on Month 1-6 essentials
- Buy more expensive items (quality tools, cast iron)
- Stock up during major sales

If you need to cut budget:
- Reduce quantities by 30-40%
- Focus on Months 1-12 only
- Skip pet/specialty categories

If certain items are unavailable:
- Substitute similar products
- Use online shopping (Bol.com, Coolblue)
- Check Marktplaats for bulk deals

---

## After 24 Months: Choose Your Path

### Option 1: Stockpile Only (Maintenance Mode)

€40/month maintenance:
- Replace items as you use them
- Rotate expiring food
- Top off depleted categories

10-year result:
- Total spent: €6,240
- Total saved: €7,154
- Net profit: €914

---

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach RECOMMENDED

€40/month maintenance + €60/month investing:
- Maintain your stockpile
- Invest €60/month in VWRL
