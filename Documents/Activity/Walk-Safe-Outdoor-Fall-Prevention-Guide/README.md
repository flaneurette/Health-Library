## 1. Mindset & Awareness

- Scan ahead, not at your feet: Look 3-5 meters ahead to detect uneven tiles, drains, or obstacles.  
- Treat all drains and small steps as potentially uneven.  
- Slow down in low-light conditions or on uneven surfaces.  
- Familiar routes: Stay alert even on familiar paths - autopilot is the main cause of trips.  
- Avoid distractions: Phones, heavy loads, or deep focus on other tasks can increase trip risk.

## 2. Footwear

- Good grip: Avoid slippery soles.  
- Toe spring: Slight upward curve helps step over small obstacles.  
- Supportive: Shoes that stabilize the foot reduce slips and uneven landings.

## 3. Protective Gear

- Helmet: Lightweight cycling or walking helmet reduces head injury risk.  
- Wrist guards: Protects against fractures during forward falls.  
- Hip padding: Optional for extra protection on uneven terrain.  
- Elbow padding: Optional, especially if prone to side-falls.

## 4. Strength & Balance

- Leg and hip strength: Walking stairs, gentle squats, or uphill walks.  
- Core strength: Helps recover balance during slips.  
- Balance exercises: Standing on one leg, heel-to-toe walks.

## 5. Yoga for Balance & Flexibility

Practicing yoga improves flexibility, posture, balance, and core strength, which reduces fall risk. Focus on gentle, beginner-friendly poses:

- Tree Pose (Vrksasana): Improves single-leg balance  
- Chair Pose (Utkatasana): Strengthens thighs and hips  
- Cat-Cow (Marjaryasana/Bitilasana): Enhances spinal flexibility and posture awareness  
- Downward Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana): Stretches hamstrings and calves for better stepping  
- Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II): Strengthens legs and improves stability  

> Tip: Start slowly, hold poses near a wall or chair for support, and breathe steadily. Even 10 minutes daily helps maintain balance over time.

## 6. Environmental Safety

- Lighting: Side or angled lighting highlights small obstacles better than overhead light.  
- Contrast: Edges of tiles, steps, or drains should be easy to see.  
- Weather awareness: Wet or icy tiles increase trip risk.  
- Regular hazard checks: Report uneven paving or broken tiles in your area.

## 7. Practical Tips for Everyday Walking

- Use flat surfaces where possible; avoid ladders and small steps after 60.  
- Lift feet slightly more than usual, especially on tiles, small bricks, or drains.  
- Evening walks: Carry a small flashlight or headlamp to improve visibility.  
- Face traffic when possible: Walk on the side of the road facing oncoming vehicles. This helps you see cars approaching and react in time.  
- Emergency planning: Know how to get help if a fall occurs.  

## 8. Indoor Safety

Even at home, falls can happen on slippery or uneven surfaces. Simple precautions make a big difference.

- Non-slip flooring: Use mats with rubber backing in bathrooms, kitchens, and entryways.  
- Steel or rubber grips: Consider installing grip strips, bars, or rails on stairs and slippery areas.  
- Good lighting: Night lights in hallways, bathrooms, and bedrooms help prevent trips in low light.  
- Clear pathways: Remove clutter, loose rugs, and cords from walking paths.  
- Stable furniture: Chairs, tables, and counters should be sturdy if used for support.  
- Footwear indoors: Avoid socks on smooth floors; use non-slip slippers or shoes.  
- Step awareness: Pay attention to small level changes, thresholds, or transitions between rooms.  
- Emergency access: Keep a phone or alert device nearby in case a fall occurs.
- Glowing steps: Consider adding glow strips to raised steps (for in the dark)
- Toilet practice: Consider always putting the toilet lid down when you leave the bathroom, falls on toilet rims are very nasty (and common) the lid buffers the fall. Its also hygienic to close the lid before flushing!
