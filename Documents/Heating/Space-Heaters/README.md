# Space Heater Safety: Risks and Tips

Space heaters are convenient for warming small areas, but they can pose health and safety risks if used improperly. This guide highlights the main risks and how to mitigate them.

## 1. Types of Space Heaters

| Type | How it works | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Convection heater | Heats air, which circulates in the room | Safer for general use, slower to warm |
| Infrared / radiant heater | Emits infrared radiation → heats objects and skin directly | Can cause burns if too close |

## 2. Common Risks

### Fire hazard
- Heaters placed too close to flammable materials (curtains, bedding, paper) can start fires.
- Old or faulty heaters increase risk.

### Skin / heat burns (especially IR heaters)
- Prolonged exposure at close range **can burn skin**, leaving temporary or permanent "netting" patterns or erythema.
- Children and pets are especially vulnerable.

### Electrical risk
- Damaged cords or plugs can cause shocks or short circuits.
- Overloading sockets is dangerous.

### Indoor air quality
- Some heaters (especially older oil or gas types) can release fumes or reduce oxygen.
- Electric heaters are generally safer for air quality.

### Overheating and dehydration
- Close proximity to heaters can dry out skin and mucous membranes.
- Long-term use may cause mild dehydration if the room is very dry.

## 3. Safety Tips

1. Maintain distance: Keep at least 1-1.5 meters from skin, furniture, curtains.
2. Avoid direct contact: Do not point IR heaters at bare skin for prolonged periods.
3. Move or adjust: Change position occasionally to avoid hot spots on skin.
4. Inspect regularly: Check cords, plugs, and grills for damage.
5. Use thermostats / timers: Avoid running heaters unattended for long periods.
6. Use barriers: Blankets, clothing, or furniture can reduce direct IR exposure while retaining warmth.
7. Keep away from water: Never use heaters in damp areas (bathrooms, near sinks) without safety rating.

## 4. Special Considerations

- Children and pets: Keep them away from direct IR exposure.
- Ventilation: Ensure the room isn’t completely sealed to avoid very dry air.
- Medical conditions: People with sensitive skin or circulatory issues should avoid prolonged close exposure.

## 5. Key Takeaways

- Infrared heaters feel hotter than they actually heat the room → risk of skin burns.
- Distance and duration matter more than room temperature.
- Regular monitoring and proper setup drastically reduce risks.
- Small precautions make space heaters safe and effective for winter warmth.
