## Staining Techniques

### Why Stain?
Most cells and microorganisms are transparent. Stains add contrast by:
- Binding to specific cell structures
- Making details visible
- Differentiating cell types

### Professional Biological Stains

| Stain Name | Color | What It Stains | Price | Source |
|------------|-------|----------------|-------|--------|
| Methylene Blue | Blue | Cell nuclei, bacteria | $8-15 | Amazon, Carolina Biological |
| Iodine Solution | Brown/Yellow | Starch, cell nuclei | $5-10 | Pharmacy (Lugol's), science suppliers |
| Eosin Y | Pink/Red | Cytoplasm, proteins | $10-15 | Science suppliers |
| Crystal Violet | Purple | Bacteria (Gram stain) | $10-15 | Science suppliers |
| Safranin | Red | Plant cells, nuclei | $10-15 | Science suppliers |
| Congo Red | Red | Plant cell walls | $12-18 | Science suppliers |

### Household Alternatives (Less Effective but Safe)

| Household Item | What It Can Stain | Effectiveness |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Food Coloring (Blue) | General staining of cells | Low - washes off easily |
| Iodine (Betadine) | Starch, general contrast | Medium - actually works! |
| Beet Juice | General plant cells | Low |
| Turmeric Solution | General yellow stain | Low-Medium |
| Soy Sauce | Weak general stain | Very Low |
| Ink (diluted) | Bacteria, general | Low - messy |

### Recommended Beginner Stain Kit
Buy a prepared set: $15-30 for 5-6 stains
- AmScope PS25 Prepared Slide & Stain Set (~$20)
- Carolina Biological Staining Kit (~$35)

DIY Minimal Kit: $15-20
- Methylene Blue
- Iodine Solution (Lugol's)
- Eosin Y
- Distilled water
- Dropper bottles

---

## Sample Preparation

### Basic Technique: Wet Mount

Materials:
- Glass slides ($5 for 50)
- Cover slips ($4 for 100)
- Dropper or pipette
- Distilled water
- Specimen

Steps:
1. Place drop of water on slide
2. Add specimen (onion skin, cheek cells, pond water)
3. Add one drop of stain (optional)
4. Place cover slip at 45° angle and slowly lower to avoid bubbles
5. Blot excess water with tissue
6. Observe!

### Sample Thickness Guidelines

| Microscope Type | Maximum Thickness | Example Specimens |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Compound (400x+) | 0.1mm or less | Single cell layer, bacteria, blood smear |
| Compound (100x) | 0.2mm | Thin leaf sections, thin onion layer |
| Stereo | Any | Whole insects, thick plant parts, coins |

### Tips for Success
- Too thick? Sample appears dark/black → slice thinner
- Bubbles? Lower cover slip slowly from one edge
- Specimen moves? Use less water or petroleum jelly at coverslip edges
- Can't focus? May be using wrong objective (start with lowest magnification)

---

## What to Observe

### Easy Specimens for Beginners

#### Kitchen & Garden (No staining needed)
- Onion skin (thin inner layer) - Large plant cells with nuclei
- Salt/sugar crystals - Crystal structures (use stereo or low compound)
- Pepper grains - Starch granules
- Yeast in sugar water - Live microorganisms (wait 30 min)
- Moss - Simple plant structures
- Flower petals (thin!) - Cell patterns

#### With Simple Staining
- Cheek cells (gently scrape inside mouth) + Methylene Blue
  - See nuclei clearly!
  - Must be very thin smear
- Elodea leaf (aquarium plant) + Iodine
  - See chloroplasts, cell walls
- Potato/banana + Iodine
  - Starch granules turn dark blue
- Bread mold + water
  - Fungal structures (let bread go moldy in sealed bag)

#### Pond/Stream Water (No prep needed)
- Paramecium - Slipper-shaped swimmers
- Euglena - Green, flagellated
- Daphnia - Water fleas (use stereo microscope)
- Algae - Various forms
- Rotifers - Tiny wheel-like organisms

Pond water tips:
- Collect from green/brown water, not clear
- Let jar sit overnight, microorganisms concentrate at top
- Use water from surface scum
- Add wheat grain or rice for bacterial food → more organisms

#### Prepared Slides
Best for learning! (~$20 for 25 slides)
- Blood smears (see red blood cells)
- Bacteria types
- Plant/animal tissues
- Insect parts

## Staining Protocols

### Protocol 1: Onion Cells (Classic Beginner)

Materials: Onion, slide, coverslip, iodine or methylene blue

Steps:
1. Cut onion in quarters
2. Peel thin inner layer (translucent "skin")
3. Place small piece in water drop on slide
4. Add tiny drop of stain
5. Wait 1-2 minutes
6. Add coverslip
7. Observe at 100x, then 400x

What you see: Box-like cells, darker nuclei, cell walls

---

### Protocol 2: Cheek Cells (Human Cells!)

Materials: Toothpick, slide, coverslip, methylene blue

Steps:
1. Gently scrape inside of clean cheek with toothpick
2. Swirl toothpick in water drop on slide
3. Add tiny drop of methylene blue
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Add coverslip
6. Observe at 100x, then 400x

What you see: Irregular shaped cells, dark blue nuclei (no cell wall - animal cells!)

---

### Protocol 3: Plant Cell Plastids

Materials: Elodea plant (aquarium stores), slide, no stain needed!

Steps:
1. Remove single young leaf
2. Place in water drop on slide
3. Add coverslip
4. Observe at 100x-400x
5. Watch for 10+ minutes

What you see: 
- Green chloroplasts (photosynthesis!)
- Cytoplasmic streaming - organelles flowing around cell edge (living process!)

---

## Advanced Staining: Gram Stain (For Bacteria)

Materials (Professional kit $25-40):
- Crystal violet
- Iodine solution
- Alcohol (decolorizer)
- Safranin
- Bacteria sample (yogurt, mouth swab)

Process (4 minutes):
1. Make thin bacterial smear, air dry, heat-fix
2. Crystal violet (1 min) → rinse
3. Iodine (1 min) → rinse
4. Alcohol (10 seconds) → rinse immediately
5. Safranin (30 sec) → rinse
6. Air dry, observe at 1000x with oil

Results:
- Purple bacteria = Gram-positive (thick cell wall)
- Pink bacteria = Gram-negative (thin cell wall)

---

## Magnification Guide

### Understanding Magnification

Total Magnification = Eyepiece × Objective

Example with standard 10x eyepiece:
- 4x objective = 40x total
- 10x objective = 100x total
- 40x objective = 400x total
- 100x objective = 1000x total (oil immersion)

### What Can You See at Each Level?

| Magnification | Field of View | What You Can Observe |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 40x-100x | 2-4mm | Whole organisms (paramecium), large cells, general structure |
| 100x-400x | 0.5-2mm | Individual cells clearly, nuclei, chloroplasts, bacteria (barely) |
| 400x-1000x | 0.1-0.5mm | Cell organelles, bacteria clearly, chromosomes (stained) |
| 1000x | <0.1mm | Individual bacteria well, blood cells in detail |

### Practical Limits
- Maximum useful magnification for light microscope: ~1000x
- Beyond this: empty magnification (bigger but no more detail)
- Resolution limit: ~0.2 micrometers (200 nanometers)
  - Cannot see viruses, molecules, atoms
  - Need electron microscope for smaller

## Maintenance & Care

### Daily Care
- Clean lenses with lens paper only (never tissues/cloth)
- Cover when not in use (dust is the enemy)
- Low power first - always start with lowest objective
- Carry properly - two hands (base + arm)

### Cleaning Solutions
- Lens cleaner: 70% isopropyl alcohol or commercial lens cleaner
- Slides: Soap and water, then 70% alcohol rinse
- Body: Damp cloth only

### Storage
- Humidity: Store in dry place (mold can grow on lenses!)
- Temperature: Avoid extreme heat/cold
- Objectives: Store with lowest power in place
- Cord wrap: Loose, not tight

### Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Can't see anything | Not focused / no light | Start at lowest mag, adjust mirror/light |
| Image too dark | Wrong lighting | Adjust diaphragm, increase light |
| Image too bright | Too much light | Close diaphragm partially |
| Blurry at high mag | Slide too thick / dirty lens | Clean objective, make thinner sample |
| Specimen washed away | Too much water | Use less water, blot excess |

## Conclusion

Microscopy is an accessible hobby that reveals hidden worlds. Start simple:
1. Get a basic compound microscope ($130-250)
2. Buy a few stains (methylene blue, iodine)
3. Start with kitchen specimens (onion, cheek cells)
4. Progress to pond water (most exciting!)
5. Join online communities (learn from others)

The invisible world is waiting! Every drop of pond water contains thousands of organisms. Every plant cell is a miniature factory. Your own body cells are fascinating structures. With patience and practice, you'll develop skills that scientists use daily.

Most important: Start simple, be patient with focusing, and enjoy the journey into the microscopic world!
