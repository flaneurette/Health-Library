# Ecology hacks.


### 1. Water-saving hacks

- Shower timer / bucket method: Turn off water while lathering, or use a bucket to catch cold-start water to reuse for plants or toilets.
- Low-flow showerheads / faucet aerators: Reduce water use while keeping pressure high.
- Greywater reuse: Collect water from washing hands, dishes, or showers to flush toilets or water plants.
- Dual-flush toilets
- Collect rainwater: Use barrels to water plants instead of tap water.
- Toilet: put a waterbottle in it, 1.5 liters, to save 1.5 liters each flush. (water displacement)

### 2. Energy-saving hacks
- Space heaters in small zones: Only heat the room you use
- Draft-proofing: Seal windows/doors to prevent heat loss - cheap, simple, high impact.
- Use lids on pots when cooking: Saves gas/electricity and reduces cooking time.
- Microwave / toaster oven vs full oven: Heat less volume, less energy.
- LED lighting: Obvious, but still one of the most effective small swaps.
- Caulk small holes, also pipes from neighbours (with fireproof caulking) this reduces: 
heatloss, noise, smells, and insects crawling into your house.

### 3. Waste & materials hacks
- Repurpose containers: Like PET bottles, jars, or tubs for storage or plant watering.
- Composting food scraps: Reduces landfill waste and gives fertilizer.
- Reusable shopping bags and containers, cotton tote bag.
- Minimal packaging shopping: Buy bulk items, avoid individually wrapped goods.

---

### 4. Small “micro-routines” that add up
- Boil only what you need: For tea, coffee, or cooking.
- Cold rinse for clothes: Wash lightly soiled clothes in cold water instead of hot.
- Unplug idle electronics: Chargers, PCs, lamps - energy vampire devices.
- Air-dry laundry: Saves energy from dryers.
- Timed lights / motion sensors: Lights only run when needed.

### 5. Food & kitchen hacks

- Freeze food scraps for stock: Save vegetable peels, onion skins, herb stems in a freezer bag. When full, simmer into homemade broth instead of buying packaged stock.
- Regrow vegetables from scraps: Green onions, lettuce, celery, and herbs can regrow in water or soil from their bases.
- Use every part of produce: Broccoli stems, beet greens, carrot tops are edible-reduces waste and stretches your budget.
- Meal planning to reduce spoilage: Cook what you have before buying more-prevents food waste.
- Ferment or pickle surplus produce: Extends shelf life without refrigeration.
- Use foograde cotton bag to microwave popcorn (no more waste)

### 6. Transportation & mobility
- Bike for short trips: Even just replacing 1-2 car trips per week adds up.
- Combine errands into one trip: Reduces fuel use and time.
- Carpool or ride-share: Split emissions when driving is necessary.
- Public transport + bike combo: Use a foldable bike for the last mile.

---

### 7. Clothing & textiles
- Repair instead of replace: Sew buttons, patch holes, darn socks-keeps items out of landfills.
- Buy secondhand or swap: Thrift stores, online marketplaces, or clothing swaps with friends.
- Wash clothes less often: Most items (jeans, sweaters) don't need washing after every wear.
- Use natural fibers when possible: Cotton, wool, linen biodegrade better than synthetics and shed fewer microplastics.
- Use enzyme cleaner to soak clothes at 60C water temperature: skip washing machine.

### 8. Cleaning & household products
- DIY cleaners: Vinegar + water for glass/surfaces, baking soda for scrubbing, lemon for degreasing.
- Reusable cleaning cloths: Old t-shirts or towels instead of paper towels.
- Bar soap over liquid: Less packaging, lasts longer (for hands, body, even dishes).
- Refill stations: Some stores let you refill detergents, shampoos, etc. in your own containers.
- Clean toilet bowl with Citric Acid. Cheap, and cleans all stains instantly.

### 9. Digital & tech habits
- Delete old emails and files: Data storage uses energy-cloud servers consume electricity.
- Stream at lower resolution: 1080p vs 4K saves bandwidth and energy.
- Avoid unnecessary printing: Digital documents when possible; print double-sided if needed.
- Repair electronics: Replace batteries, screens, or parts instead of discarding devices.
- Buy refurbished items instead of brand new.
---

### 10. Nature-positive actions
- Plant native species: Support local ecosystems and pollinators (even a windowsill herb garden helps).
- Leave wild areas in your yard: Let a corner grow naturally-provides habitat for insects and birds.
- Use peat-free soil: Peat bogs are critical carbon sinks; alternatives exist.
- Support local biodiversity: Bird feeders, bee hotels, or just leaving leaf litter for insects.

---

### 11. Smart shopping habits
- Borrow or rent instead of buying: Tools, books, party supplies-use libraries, tool shares, or rental services.
- Buy quality over quantity: One durable item beats replacing cheap ones repeatedly.
- Avoid fast fashion and disposable goods: Opt for timeless, repairable items.
- Check product certifications: FSC (wood/paper), Fair Trade, Energy Star, etc.

---

### 12. Water & garden efficiency
- Mulch garden beds: Reduces evaporation, keeps soil moist longer.
- Use ollas (clay pots) for irrigation: Buried pots slowly release water to roots-super efficient.
- Native or drought-tolerant plants: Require less watering and maintenance.

---

### Bonus: Community & systemic impact
- Join or start a tool library, seed swap, or repair café: Collective action amplifies individual efforts.
- Advocate for local green policies: Bike lanes, public transit, green spaces-systemic change matters.
- Support businesses with sustainable practices: Vote with your wallet.
