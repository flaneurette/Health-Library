# Detect if sockets are installed correctly.

Humans make mistakes. If wires are not connected properly, devices may malfunction, have a shorter lifespan, or cause issues such having live wires on switches. While this is rare, it would be useful to check the wiring of sockets in the house.

Before checking sockets, check the main switchingboard. **be very carefull here**. Don't touch anything here. Just look and notice if each channel is consistently wired (notice the color pairs) if it is, then you can check the order of the sockets.

## EU sockets

* Switch off the mains at the house breaker.
* Double-check with a multimeter that the socket is not live - even though the breaker is off, safety first.
* Wear insulated gloves (optional but adds a safety margin).
* Unscrew the socket cover.
* Inspect the wiring:
  
| Color                | Purpose             | Typical Connection / Notes |
| ---------------------| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Brown                | Live / Phase (L)    | Right screw / live pin     |
| Blue                 | Neutral (N)         | Left screw / neutral pin   |
| Yellow/Green striped | Ground / Earth (PE) | Middle or top, protective  |

* Make a note or quick sketch of where the wires come from and which pipes (useful for later remodeling or troubleshooting) and store this in a notebook or file. If later on you need to pull more wires, you'll know the pipe layout! (which saves time later on)
* Check connections are tight, no exposed copper outside clamps.
* Reassemble socket, screw cover back on.
* Turn mains back on.

Estimated: ~2-3 minutes per socket if you’re organized.

| --------------| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Black         | Hot / Live                   | Brass screw / right side                             |
| White         | Neutral                      | Silver screw / left side                             |
| Green or bare | Ground                       | Green screw or metal box                             |
| Red           | Hot / switched or second hot | Used in 240V circuits, 3-way switches                |
| Blue          | Traveler / control           | Rare in residential, sometimes in multi-way switches |

### 1. EU Standard (220–240V)

| Color                | Purpose             | Typical Connection / Notes |
| ---------------------| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Brown                | Live / Phase (L)    | Right screw / live pin     |
| Blue                 | Neutral (N)         | Left screw / neutral pin   |
| Yellow/Green striped | Ground / Earth (PE) | Middle or top, protective  |

Tips:

* Always check connections are tight, no exposed copper.
* Works for Schuko (Germany, Netherlands) and most EU outlets.

### 2. US Standard (120V duplex outlet)

| Color         | Purpose                      | Notes                                                |
| --------------| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Black         | Hot / Live                   | Brass screw / right side                             |
| White         | Neutral                      | Silver screw / left side                             |
| Green or bare | Ground                       | Green screw or metal box                             |
| Red           | Hot / switched or second hot | Used in 240V circuits, 3-way switches                |
| Blue          | Traveler / control           | Rare in residential, sometimes in multi-way switches |

Tips:

* Black or red = live, never connect to neutral.
* White = neutral.
* Ground = safety only.
* For 240V circuits (dryer/oven), typically black + red = two hots, white = neutral, green = ground.

* If you see red, treat it like black (hot) unless you know it’s a switch leg.
* Blue in US residential wiring is rare - usually control or multi-way switch traveler.
* Always double-check with a multimeter if unsure.
* if in doubt consult electro-technician
