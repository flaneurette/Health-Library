# Detect if sockets are installed correctly.

Humans make mistakes. If wires are not connected properly, devices may malfunction, have a shorter lifespan, or cause issues such having live wires on switches. While this is rare, it would be useful to check the wiring of sockets in the house.

You could buy a simple device/gadget that checks this, but cheap ones may not be very good. Especially if sockets miss ground. 

The best way is to inspect **visually.**

## Safe Socket Pre-Check Workflow

1. Wear insulated gloves before touching anything.

2. Inspect the **main switching board** first

   * Do not touch any components or terminals.
   * Just look and notice the wiring: each circuit should have consistent color pairs (live and neutral) across all outlets in the same group.
   * Look for neat, clearly connected wires - no loose strands or discoloration.

3. Document the switching board

   * Take a clear photograph of the wiring, especially if you opened the panel.
   * Store the photo safely; it will be invaluable for reference if you remodel or troubleshoot later.

4. Verify consistency of wire pairs

   * Compare all circuits in the group.
   * Ensure each color pair (e.g., brown/blue in EU, black/white in US) is connected the same way.
   * Any discrepancy is a warning sign.

5. If wiring is inconsistent

   * Do not attempt to fix it yourself.
   * Call a licensed electro-technician.

6. Once verified, you can move on to checking individual sockets.

Why this is effective

* Helps prevent accidents before opening sockets.
* Ensures you don’t accidentally test a miswired or dangerous circuit.
* Creates a visual record for future work or remodeling.

### Important

The following **assumes** that if the main-board wiring is correct, the wires should follow the same principle through the entire room or house. Sadly, this is not always the case. Sometimes, wires seem to go to sockets, but split off in other sections before they reach the socket where the wires are **already reversed**. It **can happen** that the wire color is already switched in another box, like in switches, lamp outlets. If that is the case, all our work could be useless. It is therefore advices to also remove all switches and lamp sockets and inspect an entire room. Remove all sockets, switches, lamp outlets in **one room**. (per room is easier)


## EU sockets

> TIP: some EU sockets can be reversed/inversed (flipped around) Check if it's possible. This makes it easier to switch the socket 180 degrees, so that the wire-color is similar as to the table below. This prevents tearing wires if they are inserted very strongly, or screwed too tightly. Making it a very EASY FIX: Just flip the socket around so that the colors align as indicated below.

* Switch off the mains at the house breaker.
* Double-check with a multimeter that the socket is not live - even though the breaker is off, safety first.
* Wear insulated gloves (optional but adds a safety margin).
* Unscrew the socket cover.
* Inspect the wiring POSITION **important**:
  
| Color                | Purpose             | Typical Connection / Notes | POSITION front view |
| ---------------------| ------------------- | -------------------------- |---------------------
| Brown                | Live / Phase (L)    | Right screw / live pin     | RIGHT
| Blue                 | Neutral (N)         | Left screw / neutral pin   | LEFT
| Yellow/Green striped | Ground / Earth (PE) | Middle or top, protective  | MIDDLE/TOP

* Make a note or quick sketch of where the wires come from and which pipes (useful for later remodeling or troubleshooting) and store this in a notebook or file. If later on you need to pull more wires, you'll know the pipe layout! (which saves time later on)
* Check connections are tight, no exposed copper outside clamps.
* Reassemble socket, screw cover back on.
* Turn mains back on.

Estimated: ~2-3 minutes per socket if you’re organized.

## US sockets

* Switch off the mains at the house breaker.
* Double-check with a multimeter that the socket is not live - even though the breaker is off, safety first.
* Wear insulated gloves (optional but adds a safety margin).
* Unscrew the socket cover.
* Inspect the wiring:

| --------------| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Black         | Hot / Live                   | Brass screw / right side                             |
| White         | Neutral                      | Silver screw / left side                             |
| Green or bare | Ground                       | Green screw or metal box                             |
| Red           | Hot / switched or second hot | Used in 240V circuits, 3-way switches                |
| Blue          | Traveler / control           | Rare in residential, sometimes in multi-way switches |

### 1. EU Standard (220–240V)

| Color                | Purpose             | Typical Connection / Notes |
| ---------------------| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Brown                | Live / Phase (L)    | Right screw / live pin     |
| Blue                 | Neutral (N)         | Left screw / neutral pin   |
| Yellow/Green striped | Ground / Earth (PE) | Middle or top, protective  |

Tips:

* Always check connections are tight, no exposed copper.
* Works for Schuko (Germany, Netherlands) and most EU outlets.

### 2. US Standard (120V duplex outlet)

| Color         | Purpose                      | Notes                                                |
| --------------| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Black         | Hot / Live                   | Brass screw / right side                             |
| White         | Neutral                      | Silver screw / left side                             |
| Green or bare | Ground                       | Green screw or metal box                             |
| Red           | Hot / switched or second hot | Used in 240V circuits, 3-way switches                |
| Blue          | Traveler / control           | Rare in residential, sometimes in multi-way switches |

Tips:

* Black or red = live, never connect to neutral.
* White = neutral.
* Ground = safety only.
* For 240V circuits (dryer/oven), typically black + red = two hots, white = neutral, green = ground.

---

* If you see red, treat it like black (hot) unless you know it’s a switch leg.
* Blue in US residential wiring is rare - usually control or multi-way switch traveler.
* Always double-check with a multimeter if unsure.
* if in doubt consult electro-technician
