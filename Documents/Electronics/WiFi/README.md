# Wi-Fi Risks and mitigation strategies

> For just about 8-10 euros you can buy a pretty good ethernet cable, that can mitigate any possible WiFi risk. Personally, I am not willing to wait before the science settles, and I take precautionary action.

## 1. Potential health risks

Studies, including a 2018 review [1], suggest that prolonged exposure to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi may be associated with:

- Reproductive system effects
- Impacts on brain function
- Adverse effects on learning and behavior

> Note: The evidence is not universally conclusive, but over 100 studies have reported similar findings, making it reasonable to take precautionary measures.

Key point: Exposure risk depends heavily on signal strength and proximity.

## 2. Factors Affecting Exposure

- Frequency:  
  - 2.4 GHz penetrates walls easily → higher exposure in living areas  
  - 5 GHz has shorter range, slightly less penetration, but still emits RF  

- Distance from source:  
  - Wi-Fi strength drops sharply with distance  
  - Devices close to the router receive higher exposure  

- Device usage:  
  - Continuous, high-data Wi-Fi use increases cumulative exposure  
  - Passive devices (standby, background scanning) contribute less, but still add up

## 3. Mitigation strategies

### Wired Networking
- Use Ethernet cables for desktops, laptops, and media devices  
- Benefits:  
  - Eliminates personal Wi-Fi exposure  
  - Provides faster and more stable connections  
  - Reduces latency and packet loss  
  - Feels more professional and controlled

### Selective Wi-Fi Usage
- Keep Wi-Fi off when not needed  
- Enable Wi-Fi only for mobile devices like phones or tablets  
- Position routers away from bedrooms or workspaces

### Minimize Device Emissions
- Use wired peripherals (mouse, keyboard, printers) when possible  
- Reduce always-on Wi-Fi devices in the home  
- Avoid placing devices directly on your body during use

### Environmental Considerations
- Thick walls, metal objects, and distance reduce exposure from neighbors’ Wi-Fi  
- Even weak signals contribute minimally to total exposure

## 4. Practical Recommendations

1. Connect your PC via Ethernet and disable Wi-Fi for it  
2. Measure speed via cable to confirm full line utilization  
3. Use short, high-quality cables (Cat6/Cat6a or better, 100% copper)  
4. Enable Wi-Fi only for mobile devices when needed  
5. Keep your sleep and work areas free from active Wi-Fi devices

> By combining wired connections and controlled Wi-Fi use, you maximize performance and minimize potential RF exposure, aligning both with technical and health-conscious goals.
