## Using Medication (and vitamins) Safely

### 1. Pill Aspiration Risk

Pill aspiration occurs when a pill enters the airway instead of the esophagus. This can prevent the pill from being swallowed properly and, in severe cases, may block the airway or enter the lungs.

Aspiration can be potentially life-threatening, as it may lead to choking or breathing obstruction within minutes.

### 2. Who Is Most at Risk

Pill aspiration is surprisingly common in elderly individuals, but it can also occur in younger adults, especially when:

* Pills are large or smooth
* Swallowing reflexes are slowed
* There is hesitation or difficulty swallowing pills

Aspiration can cause serious health complications, including lung infections (aspiration pneumonia) and acute choking.

### 3. Reducing the Risk

To lower the risk of pill aspiration, it is often safer—when the medication allows it—to:

* Crush or crumble tablets
* Mix the medication into a soft or semi-solid food such as yogurt, applesauce, or another suitable carrier
* Alternatively, suspend it in a thicker liquid if appropriate

This helps the body process the medication similarly to food and reduces swallowing resistance.

### 4. Vitamins and Supplements

The same precautions apply to daily vitamins and supplements, which are often large and difficult to swallow. Despite being over-the-counter, they can pose the same aspiration risks as prescription medication.

### 5. Important Safety Note

Not all medications are safe to crush or alter (e.g. extended-release or enteric-coated tablets).
Always consult a pharmacist or healthcare provider before changing how a medication is taken.
