# Top list of common risks.

---

## Seemingly vague or unexpected everyday killers

### 1. Falls

* Could be a slip in the bathroom, tripping over a rug, or even a stair misstep.
* One of the leading causes of accidental death, especially in older adults.

### 2. Choking

* Food, small objects, or even dental appliances.
* Happens more often than most realize-especially in elderly or small children.

### 3. Poisoning (including medication errors)

* Overdose, mislabeling, household chemicals, or even mixing meds.
* Often completely silent until it’s too late.

### 4. Drowning in minimal water

* Bathtubs, buckets, or even heavy rain puddles.
* “You know how to swim” doesn’t always save you.

### 5. Carbon monoxide poisoning

* From heaters, gas stoves, indoor charcoal, or faulty furnaces.
* Invisible, odorless, deadly.

### 6. Fires (non-obvious causes)

* Electrical faults, candles, cooking accidents.
* People die in their sleep or while distracted-seems mundane until it’s fatal.

### 7. Falls of less than 10 feet

* Many people underestimate low-height falls-stumble from a chair, roof edge, or ladder.
* Often treated lightly until it causes serious internal injuries.
* Fall from a truck

### 8. Accidental suffocation

* Plastic bags, bedding, or even small children trapped under pillows.
* Silent and fast.

### 9. Heatstroke / hypothermia in everyday scenarios

* Leaving someone in a hot car, exposure during mild weather, or forgetting hydration.
* People underestimate the danger in “normal” weather conditions.

### 10. Vehicle incidents not involving collisions

* Being pinned by a car door, backing accidents in driveways, or parking lot mishaps.
* Happens surprisingly often and feels minor until it’s fatal.

### 11. Medical complications from minor events

* Blood clots after long sitting, minor infections turning septic, or heart arrhythmias triggered by stress.
* These feel vague and random but are deadly.

### 12. Falls from slippery or “normal” surfaces

* Wet floors, ice patches, bathroom tiles.
* Low probability individually, but common statistically.

### 13. Suffocation by food or small items during sleep

* Pill aspiration, gum, or even small toy pieces.
* Rarely expected, but surprisingly frequent in young children.

### 14. Household appliance accidents

* Washing machines, lawn mowers, power tools-even vacuum cords can trip or entangle.

### 15. Struck by objects in the home

* Falling shelves, cabinets, or furniture tipping over.
* Very common in children and older adults.

# Common every day risks

### 1. Driving (cars)

* Why it seems safe: Most people drive daily without incident.
* Reality: Car crashes are the leading cause of accidental death worldwide.
* Stat: In the U.S., ~42,000 people die in car accidents per year. Short trips close to home are the deadliest.

### 2. Driving motorcycles

* Why it seems safe: Fun and liberating; often for short rides.
* Reality: Motorcyclists are 28 times more likely to die per mile than car drivers.
* Often on weekends: more leisure traffic, careless drivers (less attention than on work days)

### 3. Walking or jogging

* Why it seems safe: “It’s just exercise, what could go wrong?”
* Reality: Pedestrians are vulnerable; jaywalking or walking at night increases risk.
* Stat: In the U.S., ~6,000 pedestrians die annually, many in urban areas.

### 4. Using power tools / DIY at home

* Why it seems safe: “I’ve done this a hundred times.”
* Reality: Every year thousands get hospitalized for saws, drills, and ladders.

### 5. Swimming or boating

* Why it seems safe: “I know how to swim.”
* Reality: Drowning can happen in seconds; alcohol or currents are often overlooked.
* Stat: Drowning is a top 5 cause of accidental death in children and young adults.

### 6. Alcohol at social events

* Why it seems safe: Everyone drinks socially.
* Reality: Even moderate drinking increases risk of accidents, falls, and health issues.

### 7. Climbing ladders or rooftops

* Why it seems safe: “It’s just a quick fix.”
* Reality: Falls from even 10-15 feet can cause serious injury or death.

### 8. Contact sports (football, hockey, MMA)

* Why it seems safe: Regular training and helmets give confidence.
* Reality: Concussions, torn ligaments, and fractures are extremely common.
* Stat: ~1.6-3.8 million sports-related concussions in the U.S. each year.

### 9. Taking medications incorrectly or mixing with alcohol

* Why it seems safe: “I just take my meds.”
* Reality: Interaction with alcohol or other drugs can be lethal.

### 10. Everyday household fires

* Why it seems safe: “I’ve lit a stove a million times.”
* Reality: Cooking fires are a leading cause of home injury and death.
* Stat: In the U.S., ~2,500 people die annually in home fires, mostly from smoke inhalation.

## Ranked list of the most underestimated everyday risks

### 1. Driving a car short distances

* Feels safe: “It’s just around the block.”
* Reality: Most car accidents happen close to home.
* Impact: Leading cause of accidental death worldwide; tens of thousands of deaths annually in the U.S. alone.

### 2. Walking or jogging near roads

* Feels safe: “I’m exercising, I’m careful.”
* Reality: Pedestrians are highly vulnerable; jaywalking and distracted drivers are major threats.

### 3. Driving a motorcycle

* Feels safe: Fun and exhilarating; often casual weekend rides.
* Reality: 28x higher chance of dying per mile than car drivers. Helmets help, but risk remains high.

### 4. Using ladders or climbing onto roofs

* Feels safe: “I’ve done this a hundred times.”
* Reality: Falls from even a few meters can cause permanent injury or death.

### 5. Household cooking

* Feels safe: “I cook every day.”
* Reality: Cooking fires are a leading cause of home injury and death. Grease and unattended stoves are sneaky killers.

### 6. Boating, swimming, or being near water
