# Room treatment

On average, a **36 watt bulb** (12 watts real UVC emmision) is **minimally** required to treat a small to average room. More wattage, means more effectiveness.

Required UV dose: 5,000 µJ/cm² for proper desinfection.

As you can see in the table below, the **inverse square law** says that intensity drops dramatically as the distance increases. Hence the requirement of high wattage to cover adequate space.

### UVC Surface Disinfection - 36 W Lamp (12.2 W UVC Output)

**Formula (inverse-square law for hemispherical spread):**

$$
I(d) = \frac{P}{2 \pi d^2}, \quad t = \frac{D}{I(d)}
$$

Or: I(d) = P / (2 * pi * d^2),  t = D / I(d)

Where:

* (I(d)) = irradiance at distance (d) (µW/cm²)
* (P) = total UVC output of lamp (µW) = 12,200,000 µW
* (d) = distance from lamp (cm)
* (D) = required UV dose (µJ/cm²) = 5,000 µJ/cm²
* (t) = exposure time (seconds)
