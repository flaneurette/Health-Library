# General advice of using UV light (UVA, UVB and UVC)

The document discusses the practical use of UV light and safety concerns.

### Misconceptions about UV

Nowadays, many consumer appliances claim to disinfect or even sterilize objects, rooms, and air. While this is true for certain UV ranges, such as UVC and Far-UVC, UVA and UVB do not have this effect.

Many inexpensive devices advertise that they use UVC, but in reality, they often use UVA or UVB lights or LEDs. For a consumer, verifying this is difficult you would need a radiometer or UV dosimeter to test the light and confirm it is truly UVC.

Some products that claim to use UVC allow direct exposure of the light in the way the appliance is built. This is dangerous because UVC is highly harmful to humans. Ideally, UVC should only be used in closed containers with no exposure to skin or eyes. If you can see the UV light, this could indicate it is not UVC. If it is real UVC, exposure could cause serious damage to the eyes and skin.

### Advice

- When buying an appliance that claims to use UVC, ask for an official lab measurement sheet to verify its wavelength.
- For absolute certainty, consider using a radiometer, dosimeter, or UV test strips to check the UV output.
- If lights are exposed (if you can see them clearly in the appliance) it probably is not UVC. If it is, you risk serious danger!
- Never look at a UVC emitting LED or bulb. UVC is invisible and causes severe damage.

### Possible risks

- Remember UVC kills microbes, but when they die they produce endotoxins. See the section below on Effects of UVC Cleaning for more information.
- Ozone might be produced in UVC cleaning, which can lead to other health issues.
- Skin damage, increasing cancer risk.
- Serious irreversible eye damage.

# UVC LEDS and Bulbs

Be especially careful with appliances containing UVC LEDs. Most UVC LEDs are expensive, ranging from $3–$6 per LED. If a cheap appliance has many UVC LEDs, it might not actually be using UVC. Manufacturing real UVC LEDs is difficult, and many LEDs on the market are not genuine UVC.

# Understanding Ultraviolet (UV) Light

Ultraviolet (UV) light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths shorter than visible light but longer than X-rays. UV is divided into several ranges, each with unique characteristics, uses, and safety considerations:

- UVA (315–400 nm): Long-wave UV, penetrates deep into the skin. Commonly associated with tanning and skin aging.  
- UVB (280–315 nm): Medium-wave UV, responsible for sunburn and vitamin D synthesis. More energetic than UVA and can cause DNA damage.  
- UVC (100–280 nm): Short-wave UV, mostly absorbed by the atmosphere. Extremely effective at killing bacteria and viruses (germicidal). Very dangerous for eyes and skin.  
- Far-UVC (200–230 nm): A sub-range of UVC. Kills microbes effectively while being much safer for human exposure under controlled doses.  
- Extreme UV (<100 nm): Absorbed by air; used only in specialized lab equipment. Highly dangerous.

# Effects of UVC Cleaning

While UVC is highly effective at inactivating bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms, there are several secondary effects to be aware of:

## 1. Endotoxins
- What they are: Endotoxins are toxins released from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria when the bacteria die.  
- UVC and endotoxins: Research shows that UVC irradiation can inactivate endotoxins, particularly in water and liquid solutions:
  - Endotoxin inactivation is proportional to UV dose, with rates around 0.55 endotoxin units/mL per mJ/cm².  
  - First-order kinetics have been observed, with destruction rates of 6–10 minutes for levels up to 100 EU/mL.  
  - Practical applications include maintaining endotoxin levels below 0.125 EU in water distribution systems and sterilizing parenteral solutions.  
- Caveat: Most studies focus on water or solutions. Endotoxin release on solid surfaces or in air after UVC disinfection is still under-researched and may represent a blind spot in the literature.

### Note on UV and Endotoxin Release in Complex Systems

Research indicates that in environments like sewage effluent or reclaimed water, UV disinfection can exacerbate endotoxin release:

- Observation: UV or Fe(VI) alone cannot completely eliminate endotoxins and may increase their presence when bacteria are inactivated.  
- Implication: While UV is effective at killing microorganisms, endotoxin remnants may persist or even increase, especially in complex biological matrices.  
- Practical takeaway: For environments with high endotoxin load, UV treatment alone may be insufficient. Additional treatment methods may be needed to manage residual endotoxins and reduce inhalation hazards.

## 2. Ozone Production
- What it is: Ozone (O₃) is a reactive oxygen species that can form when UVC interacts with oxygen molecules in air.  
- How it occurs: UVC lamps, especially those emitting wavelengths below ~240 nm, can split O₂ molecules, forming ozone.  
- Risks: Ozone is toxic to humans, irritating the respiratory system and eyes. High concentrations can cause coughing, shortness of breath, or lung damage.  
- Mitigation: Proper ventilation or using ozone-free UVC lamps can reduce the risk. Many modern UVC LEDs emit wavelengths above 240 nm and produce little or no ozone.

## 3. Practical Notes
- UVC cleaning is most effective in controlled, closed environments.  
- Surfaces should be wiped or cleaned after UVC exposure if endotoxin removal is necessary.  
- Ensure proper ventilation if UVC lamps may produce ozone.  
- Direct exposure to humans is still dangerous, even if ozone and endotoxin risks are managed.

Key Notes:  
- Most germicidal effective: UVC (254 nm) is standard in sterilization lamps; Far-UVC (~222 nm) is almost as effective but safer for human exposure.  
- Germicidal dose is the UV energy required to inactivate 99% of microbes; it depends on wavelength, distance, and exposure time.  
- Safety first: Even short exposure to 254 nm UVC can severely damage eyes and skin. Far-UVC has limited penetration and is safer under strict limits.
