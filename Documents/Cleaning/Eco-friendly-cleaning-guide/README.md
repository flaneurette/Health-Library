# Natural & Eco-Friendly House Cleaning Guide

A simple, effective approach to cleaning your home using natural, ecological, and bio-friendly products.

My personal favourites are:

- Citric Acid
- Enzyme cleaners such as Biotex brand.
- Microfiber cloth.

## The essentials

These five items cover 90% of your cleaning needs:

### 1. Citric acid
Best for:
- Limescale and hard water deposits (kettles, faucets, showerheads)
- Toilet bowls, removes all stains.
- Dissolving mineral buildup
- Flooring (check if the floor is acid resistant)
- Kitchens

How to use: Mix 1-2 tablespoons per liter of warm water. Let it soak for about 20-40 minutes on the surface you use it on. The longer, the more corrosive. I often use it in a spray bottle, very effective for the toilet bowl. Be amazed how quickly it will be sparkling clean!

Citric acid is also a food addative and can preseve bottles of water or home-made soda. It's cheap.

### 2. White vinegar
Best for:
- Glass and mirrors
- General surface cleaning
- Deodorizing

Note: Similar to citric acid but less effective on tough limescale

### 3. Baking soda (Sodium bicarbonate)
Best for:
- Scrubbing sinks, tubs, and stovetops
- Deodorizing carpets and fridges

How to use: Mix with water to make a paste for scrubbing

### 4. Castile soap or regular dish soap (ECO brand)
Best for:
- Floors, counters, and most surfaces
- General cleaning

How to use: Just a few drops in water is enough

### 5. Microfiber cloths
The secret weapon:
- Clean most surfaces with just water
- Reusable for years
- More effective than disposable wipes
- Machine washable

Reguarly clean them in hot water, every 2-3 days.

### 6. Alcohol solution (occasional use)
Best for:
- Electronics (keyboards, phones, remote controls)
- Disinfecting after illness in the home
- Medical/first aid uses
- Rims of glasses

DIY recipe: 70% isopropyl alcohol + 30% water in a spray bottle, use with washable cloths

Note: Not needed for routine cleaning soap and water is sufficient for normal household bacteria. Save this for when you actually need disinfection.

> ❌ There are risks because alcohol is considered low toxic.

## Enzyme cleaners

Enzyme cleaners are very useful for stains, biofilms and general purpose cleaning. They literally disolve any of it, in matter of seconds.

Personally, I use Biotex. Not only for hand-washed laundry, but also to clean:

- Clothes
- Shoes
- Garden flooring: hard wood, tiles, stones.
- Wood
- Glass bottles (remove biofilms)
- Plastics
- Anything that stains or has bacterial biofilms (can be invisible)

Let it process for at least an hour at 60 degrees celsius water temperature, then rinse.

Always test before using an enzyme cleaner as they might affect natural products. Do not wash wool and silk in it.

## What You DON'T Need

## Realistic Cleaning Frequency

```
| Area                 | Frequency 
|----------------------|------------------------------
| Bathrooms            | Weekly 
| Kitchen counters     | After cooking
| Floors               | Weekly or bi-weekly
| Door handles/faucets | Weekyly/Monthly or when visibly dirt
```

## Towels

Be careful with towels and they can spread bacteria unto dishes. If you do use them clean them very often.

## Getting Started

Start with these four items:
1. Citric acid
2. White vinegar
3. Dish soap
4. Microfiber cloths

That's really all you need for a clean, healthy home that's better for you, your wallet, and the environment.
