# Endotoxins in Water: Understanding and Treatment

## What are endotoxins?

Endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides, LPS) are components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.  
- Released when bacteria die or are lysed.  
- Heat-stable and mostly resistant to chemical or UV treatment. 

## Risks
 
⚠️ Can trigger immune responses if ingested in high amounts, but normal water contains low levels.

⚠️ Can pose health effects in higher doses, including inflammation; potential links to cardiovascular risks are being studied.

⚠️ Medically unknown risks, more research needs to be done.

## Who is at risk?

- Elderly individuals  
- Infants and young children  
- Immunocompromised people (e.g., due to medications or disease)  
- People with chronic illnesses  
- Individuals with organ failure

## The issue of concern

Many (cheap) waterfilters trap bacteria inside the filter. When they continue to reproduce inside the filter, and constantly die, they release endotoxins on a constant basis. These filters can therefore build-up significant levels of endotoxins, which are small enough to pass through the filter, unless a very good filtration system is used. See below for advice on how to filter endotoxins from the pre-filter stage.

## Removal

❌ Activated carbon filters might increase endotoxin levels locally.  
❌ UV treatment does not remove (all) endotoxins.  
❌ Boiling does not destroy all endotoxins.  
❌ Stomach acid does not eliminate all endotoxins, but low doses are generally harmless.

## Steps to treat water

```
Raw Water
  │
  ├─ Bacteria present ✅
  ├─ Exotoxins present? /low unless pre-formed
  └─ Endotoxins present? /low

Step 1: Filtration
  │
  ├─ Bacteria trapped and die inside filter ✅
  ├─ Exotoxins mostly removed ❌/low
  └─ Endotoxins inside filter; present 🟢

Step 2: Boiling
  │
  ├─ Remaining bacteria killed ✅
  ├─ Heat-labile exotoxins destroyed ✅
  └─ Endotoxins heat-stable; remain in small amounts 🟢

Step 3: Stomach Acid
  │
  ├─ Any surviving bacteria killed ✅
  ├─ Exotoxins denatured ✅
  └─ Endotoxins stable, small dose tolerated 🟢

Outcome:
  - Minimal bacterial exposure
  - Most exotoxins destroyed
  - Endotoxin exposure very low, harmless for healthy adults

| Filter Type              | Approximate Pore Size | Effect on Endotoxins                      | Notes                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ultrafiltration (UF)     | 0.01–0.1 µm           | Removes most endotoxins                   | Ceramic or polymer UF membranes; requires proper maintenance                                          |
| Nanofiltration (NF)      | 0.001–0.01 µm         | Removes nearly all endotoxins             | Higher cost, usually used in industrial or lab settings                                               |
| Reverse Osmosis (RO)     | 0.0001 µm             | Nearly complete removal                   | Removes almost all bacteria, viruses, endotoxins, and dissolved solids; often paired with pre-filters |
| Microfiltration (MF)     | 0.1–0.5 µm            | Removes bacteria but most endotoxins pass | Good for pathogen removal but not for endotoxins                                                      |
```

✅ Key point: Endotoxins are smaller than bacteria, so filters that block bacteria (0.2–0.5 µm) will not reliably remove LPS.

## Recommendation

To achieve extremely clean water, including removal of endotoxins, reverse osmosis (RO) is the gold standard.  
- For typical home water, filtration + boiling is usually safe for healthy adults, as endotoxin levels are naturally low.  
- Activated carbon or UV(C) treatments are good for chemicals and bacteria, but not sufficient for endotoxins and might even promote them!
- Always use clean filters, regularly replace them (the quicker the better)
- Prevent small and cheap faucet mounted filters, they can buildup very quickly!
- Rule of thumb: the more expensive the filter, the better they are. Don't expect ultra clean water from a $10 filter. 

## Chosing a waterfilter

- Buy the best one, most expensive you can afford. (a lifetime investment)
- Avoid activated carbon filters
- Preferably a reverse osmosis filter, but is expensive.
- Do not use a plastic waterfilter can/tank, this can leach additional nano particles and plastic chemicals. Use glass or stainless steel instead, where possible.
- Avoid cheap filters.
- Use a tank-less system, this prevents microbial biofilms from occuring.
- Use a system that is easy to maintain
- Replace filters regularly
