Higher intakes of monoglycerides and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471 and E472) were associated with higher risks of all studied outcomes. Among these emulsifiers, lactic ester of monoglycerides and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472b) was associated with higher risks of CVD and cerebrovascular diseases, and citric acid ester of monoglycerides and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472c) was associated with higher risks of CVD and coronary heart disease.

## Important Notes:

1. "Southampton Six": E102, E104, E110, E122, E124, and E129 were identified in a 2007 study as potentially linked to hyperactivity in children. Products containing these in the EU must carry warnings.

2. Individual Sensitivity: The prevalence of adverse reactions to food additives is estimated at 1-2% in children and 1% in adults, but higher (2-7%) in children with atopic conditions.

3. Regulatory Differences: E-numbers approved in one region may be banned or restricted in others. This list reflects concerns raised by various health authorities worldwide.

4. Dosage Matters: Many of these additives are considered safe at approved levels, but concerns arise with high consumption or in sensitive individuals.

5. Not All E-Numbers Are Bad: Many E-numbers are natural substances (like E300 - Vitamin C) and are completely safe.

Recommendation: Those concerned about food additives should focus on eating fresh, unprocessed foods and carefully reading ingredient labels. People with allergies, asthma, or children with behavioral issues may benefit from avoiding the additives listed above.

## Android apps to scan labels

I personally like "Foodi; Ecode Additives scanner." It works very well, but there is one caveat: sometimes it lists some additives as safe while it isn't. Use it with precaution, but the scanner is excellent.
