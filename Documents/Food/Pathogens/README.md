  # Sources of pathogens in food.

This list contains surprising causes of bacteria and pathogens in common food most people think is safe, while it isn't.

> Meat, fish and poulty are the number one carrier of pathogens, bacteria and even worms. Because bacteria, worms live inside the animals intestines and body. It is even worse on meat that has been processed: meat that have been grinded like hamburger meat have even more bacteria, because grinding meat spreads bacteria deep inside the meat , requiring even more heat to kill them.

# General advice
- Avoid meat, fish and poultry if you can. i.e. eat plant based diet.
- If you use meats, poultry and fish: cook throroughly, the hotter the better.
- Avoid meat that has been grinded, that includes vegan meats.
- Avoid raw fish, and shellfish.
- Wash fruits
- Wash vegetables (baking soda might help, but uncertain)
- Avoid fruits that has been cut and pre-packaged.
- Avoid raw sprouts, or wash them very good.
- Avoid prepackaged salads, buy whole, cut on demand.
- Avoid unroasted nuts if possible. Roast them if you can.
- Check expiration dates often.
- Avoid unpasturized milks and cheeses.
- Avoid soft cheeses if possible.

| 9    | Cooked leftovers (pasta, meat)      | *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus*, *Alternaria* | Various mycotoxins        | Discard all - protein-rich environment promotes dangerous mold growth.       |
| 10   | Shredded, crumbled, sliced cheese   | *Penicillium*, *Cladosporium*   | Mycotoxins, allergies            | Discard all - high surface area allows deep penetration.                     |

| 17   | Cake, muffins, pastries             | *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus*    | Respiratory allergies, toxins    | Discard - moisture allows deep invisible mold growth.                        |
| 18   | Dried fruits (raisins, dates)       | *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*    | Aflatoxins, ochratoxin           | Discard if moldy - concentrated sugars don't prevent toxin production.       |
| 19   | Coffee beans                        | *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*    | Ochratoxin A (kidney damage)     | Buy fresh, store properly - roasting reduces but doesn't eliminate toxins.   |
| 20   | Firm vegetables (carrots, cabbage)  | *Alternaria*, *Botrytis*        | Generally low toxin risk         | Cut away moldy area (1+ inch margin) if surface mold only.                   |
| 21   | Firm fruits (apples, pears)         | *Penicillium*, *Alternaria*     | Patulin (in apples)              | Cut off mold (1 inch margin) if small spot; discard if extensive.           |
| 22   | Hard cheese (cheddar, parmesan)     | *Penicillium* (various species) | Low risk if properly handled     | Safe to cut off mold (1 inch around & below) - dense texture prevents spread.|
| 23   | Hard salami & dry-cured meats       | *Penicillium nalgiovense* (safe)| Low - intentional mold           | Surface mold usually safe to wipe/scrub off - intentionally dried for safety.|
| 24   | Jams & jellies (high sugar, sealed) | *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus*    | Low if high sugar content        | Can scrape off surface mold if thick jam layer remains - sugar preserves.    |
| 25   | Hard cured sausages (pepperoni)     | *Penicillium* (white mold)      | Low - beneficial mold            | Surface mold safe to wipe off - low moisture prevents deep growth.           |

**Most Dangerous Mycotoxins:**

1. **Aflatoxins** (*Aspergillus*) - Highly carcinogenic; damage liver; found in nuts, corn, grains
2. **Ochratoxin A** (*Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*) - Kidney damage, carcinogenic; found in grains, coffee, dried fruits
3. **Patulin** (*Penicillium*) - Immunosuppressive, neurotoxic; found in apples and apple products
4. **Fumonisins** (*Fusarium*) - Linked to cancer; found in corn
5. **Trichothecenes** (*Fusarium*) - Immune suppression, GI damage; found in grains
6. **Zearalenone** (*Fusarium*) - Hormonal disruption; found in corn and grains

**High-Risk Groups:**
- Pregnant women
- Infants and children
- Immunocompromised individuals
- People with respiratory conditions (mold allergies/asthma)

**Safe/Intentional Molds:**
- *Penicillium roqueforti* - Blue cheese, Gorgonzola
- *Penicillium camemberti* - Brie, Camembert
- *Penicillium nalgiovense* - Salami casings
- *Aspergillus oryzae* - Soy sauce, miso, sake

**Storage Tips to Prevent Mold:**
- Keep refrigerator below 4°C (40°F)
- Store foods in airtight containers
- Use foods before expiration dates
- Keep storage areas clean and dry
- Don't sniff moldy food (inhaling spores is harmful)


# Surprising sources of pathogens

### 1. Leafy greens grown in soil

Examples: spinach, kale, lettuce

Risk: Can carry E. coli or Salmonella from contaminated water or manure. Washing helps, but bacteria can hide in crevices.

### 2. Soft fruits with skin you eat

Examples: cantaloupe, watermelon, berries

Risk: Salmonella and Listeria can live on the skin, which you might transfer to the flesh while cutting.

### 3. Pre-packaged salad mixes

Risk: Multiple people handle them; once cut, bacteria multiply faster. E. coli, Listeria, Salmonella.

### 4. Cheese rinds

Examples: brie, camembert, blue cheese

Risk: Surface mold is intentional, but bacteria like Listeria can hide on the rind.

### 5. Ready-to-eat sandwiches

Risk: Contaminated deli meat, mayonnaise, or improperly washed veggies. Bacteria grow if not refrigerated promptly.

### 6. Bakery items with cream or custard

Examples: eclairs, cream-filled pastries

Risk: Can harbor Salmonella or Listeria if made with raw eggs or dairy.

### 7. Ice machines and ice cubes

Risk: Bacteria from tap water or unclean ice machines. Some strains of E. coli or Listeria can survive freezing.

### 8. Coffee shop drinks

Examples: milk-based drinks, smoothies

Risk: Milk or plant-based alternatives can harbor Listeria if left at room temperature too long. Blended fruit can carry Salmonella.

### 9. Fermented foods gone wrong

Examples: homemade kimchi, kombucha

Risk: Usually safe, but improper fermentation or contaminated containers can let unwanted bacteria grow.

### 10. Packaged nuts and seeds

Risk: Rare, but can carry Salmonella if not roasted or stored correctly. People forget they can spoil or absorb moisture easily.
