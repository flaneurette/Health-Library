# Surprising sources of pathogens in food.

This list contains surprising causes of bacteria and pathogens in common food most people think is safe, while it isn't.

> Meat is the number one carrier of pathogens, bacteria and even worms. Because bacteria, worms live inside the animals intestines and body. It is even worse on meat that has been processed: meat that have been grinded like hamburger meat have even more bacteria, because grinding meat spreads bacteria deep inside the meat , requiring even more heat to kill them.

# Surprising sources

### 1. Leafy greens grown in soil

Examples: spinach, kale, lettuce

Risk: Can carry E. coli or Salmonella from contaminated water or manure. Washing helps, but bacteria can hide in crevices.

### 2. Soft fruits with skin you eat

Examples: cantaloupe, watermelon, berries

Risk: Salmonella and Listeria can live on the skin, which you might transfer to the flesh while cutting.

### 3. Pre-packaged salad mixes

Risk: Multiple people handle them; once cut, bacteria multiply faster. E. coli, Listeria, Salmonella.

### 4. Cheese rinds

Examples: brie, camembert, blue cheese

Risk: Surface mold is intentional, but bacteria like Listeria can hide on the rind.

### 5. Ready-to-eat sandwiches

Risk: Contaminated deli meat, mayonnaise, or improperly washed veggies. Bacteria grow if not refrigerated promptly.

### 6. Bakery items with cream or custard

Examples: eclairs, cream-filled pastries

Risk: Can harbor Salmonella or Listeria if made with raw eggs or dairy.

### 7. Ice machines and ice cubes

Risk: Bacteria from tap water or unclean ice machines. Some strains of E. coli or Listeria can survive freezing.

### 8. Coffee shop drinks

Examples: milk-based drinks, smoothies

Risk: Milk or plant-based alternatives can harbor Listeria if left at room temperature too long. Blended fruit can carry Salmonella.

### 9. Fermented foods gone wrong

Examples: homemade kimchi, kombucha

Risk: Usually safe, but improper fermentation or contaminated containers can let unwanted bacteria grow.

### 10. Packaged nuts and seeds

Risk: Rare, but can carry Salmonella if not roasted or stored correctly. People forget they can spoil or absorb moisture easily.
