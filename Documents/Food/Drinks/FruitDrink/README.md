> TIP: instead of dried powder, you can also blend berries, and filter them. But requires fresh fruit.

# Cost

| Component                       | Estimated cost   |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Freeze-dried fruit powder (5 g) | ~€0.20–€0.40     |
| Xylitol (6 g)                   | ~€0.08–€0.12     |
| Citric/malic/others             | ~€0.02–€0.05     |

You get a much more healthy fruit drink than softdrink, and it is slightly cheaper too.

### Instructions

1. Combine dry ingredients in a small bowl. Mix well.
2. Store in airtight container - this is your ready-to-use powder.
3. To make 1 liter of drink:

   * Dissolve the 20-22 g powder in 100-200 mL warm water first (helps xylitol dissolve).
   * Then add 800-900 mL cold water. Stir or shake until fully mixed.
4. Chill or add ice if desired.

### Notes / Tips

* Adjust sweetness: Increase xylitol by up to 3 g if you like sweeter drinks.
* Fruit flavor: More powder = stronger color and taste.
* Acidity: You can tweak citric/malic acid to taste - too much makes it sour.
* Mix ahead: You can pre-make multiple servings; just store the powder in a dry, airtight container.

* No artificial sweeteners - just xylitol.
* No preservatives or artificial colors - only fruit powders and acids.
* Safe for blood sugar, gut, and vascular health at normal consumption.
