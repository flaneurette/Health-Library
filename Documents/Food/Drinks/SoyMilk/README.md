# Soy Milk recipe

Making soy milk at home is about 50% cheaper than the lowest commercial brand price. Plus, you'll get more protein and less fillers.

Cost:  ≈ ~€0.40-0.60 per liter.

> TIP: Buy bio-organic soybeans, better for health and environment.

## Creamy Homemade Soymilk

### Ingredients (for ~1 liter)

* 100 g dry soybeans
* 1 liter fresh water (plus extra for soaking)
* Optional: pinch of salt, sweetener (dates, maple syrup, agave, Bolero powder), or vanilla

---

### Step 1: Soak Soybeans

* Rinse 100 g soybeans.
* Soak in plenty of water for 8-12 hours (overnight).
* Soybeans will double in size.

---

### Step 2: Blend

* Drain and rinse soybeans.
* Blend with 1 liter fresh water until smooth.
* Tip: Blend longer for creamier milk (1-2 minutes).

---

### Step 3: Boil Carefully

* Pour blended soy mixture into a pot.
* Bring to boil slowly, stirring often.
* Boil 10-15 minutes (soy foams, so watch closely).
* Boiling is important: destroys the raw bean taste and makes it digestible.

---

### Step 4: Strain

* Strain through nut milk bag, fine sieve, or clean kitchen towel.
* Press gently to extract as much milk as possible.

> TIP: The leftover pulp (okara) is edible, use for baking, smoothies, or cooking.

### Step 5: Make it Creamy Without Thickeners

* Use less water if you want creamier milk (e.g., 900 ml instead of 1 L).
* Blend longer to emulsify the water and soy - natural creaminess comes from soy solids.
* Optional: add a few soaked cashews or almonds while blending for extra creaminess (small cost, adds richness).

---

### Step 6: Flavoring (Optional)

* Sweeten with maple syrup, sugar, or dates.
* Vanilla or cinnamon for extra flavor.

---

### Step 7: Storage

* Store in the fridge for 4-5 days.
* Shake before use - natural separation happens but no gellan gum needed.

---

### Benefits

* High protein: ~3-4 g per 100 ml (vs 1 g in cheap soymilk)
* No fillers or gums - fully natural
* Eco-friendly: uses only soybeans and water, pulp is reused
* Cost-effective: 100 g soybeans ≈ ~€0.40-0.60/L

---

> Tip: If you make 2 L at once, double the recipe, keep in the fridge - saves time in the morning.
