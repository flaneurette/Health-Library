# Kitchen Plastics Guide

A practical guide to common plastics used in food and kitchenware, including health risks, temperature limits, and recommended uses.  

> ⚠️ Note: No plastic is perfectly inert. This guide focuses on realistic kitchen scenarios like steaming, microwaving, freezing, and storage. Always follow manufacturer instructions, but be aware of the risks that plastic have, even if the evidence isn't yet conclusive. Since science is updated constantly, always look at the most recent data. However, it is safe to assume that ALL plastics can potentially be disruptive to our health. This document was written in december 2025.

## Introduction

These days, many plastic items in the kitchen are BPA free. One might think: Oh, then the plastic is safe to use! this is a common misconception. All plastics release nano particles as well as chemicals when they are heated, scratched or aged. 

⚠️ BPA free does not mean there isn't a risk.
> When BPA is removed, it's often swapped for other bisphenols (like BPS, BPF, BPZ) that aren't as well-studied but show similar estrogenic activity, potentially posing the same health risks.

## Why This Matters

Many plastics can release small amounts of chemicals or microplastics, especially when:

- Heated
- Scratched or damaged
- Used with fatty or acidic foods

Some compounds (like BPA, BPS, BPF) can mimic hormones in the body. Awareness and informed choices can reduce chronic exposure, especially for infants, children, and hormone-sensitive adults.

## Nano particles

All plastics can release nano particles. A small plastic bottle can release up to millions of nano particles, and leach chemicals when heated, scratched or aged. Therefore, it is always better to use:

1. ✅ Metal container
   > Prefer thoroughly cleaned stainless steel to prevent biofilm build-up. Be cautious with aluminium and copper, as they can leach into the body and potentially be dangerous to your health.
   
3. ✅ Glass container
   > Glass is inert, but can lead to a build-up of microbial biofilms which are not visible to the eye. Reguarly cleaning glassware is recommended. And once in a while use a emzyme cleaner for tough biofilms.

Wherever possible. Only resort to plastic when there is no viable alternative, and then use it moderately in low heat.

## The PP Polypropylene Case

Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most used plastics nowadays. It is generally considered a safe,
BPA-free plastic for food use, but it can still leach additives, antioxidants, or other manufacturing chemicals (like oleamide) into food or liquids, especially when heated, scratched, or exposed to acidic/fatty substances, 
with studies finding migration of numerous chemical features from PP products. While less prone to leaching harmful compounds like BPA than other plastics, using PP containers for hot/fatty foods and replacing worn ones 
reduces potential risk. It has a moderate risk to it, and since it is used in many kitchen appliances, its safer to avoid it if possible. 

> ⚠️ Possible risk: There studies underway that explore the carcinogenic risks of nano plastics, such as in PP.
In animals studies they did find that chemicals in PP can cause breast cancer cells to proliferate.

## Practical Tips

1. Heat + fat = higher leach risk – avoid heating fatty or acidic foods in plastic.  
2. Avoid scratches or damage – leaching increases with surface damage.  
3. Rotate or replace – older or discolored plastic containers may leach more.  
4. Prefer alternatives for infants – glass, stainless steel. 
5. Check recycling codes – #5 (PP), #2 (HDPE)
6. Water filter Use a proper waterfilter to remove any plastics/particles/BPA from tapwater.
