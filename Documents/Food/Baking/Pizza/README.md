## Ingredients (makes 4 pizzas, ~30 cm diameter)

### For the Dough

## Method

### Day 1: Make the Dough

1. Dissolve yeast:
   - Add 1g fresh yeast to 325ml room temperature water (20-22°C). Stir gently and let sit 2-3 minutes.

2. Mix flour and water:
   - Pour flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast water gradually while mixing with your hand or a wooden spoon.
   - Mix until no dry flour remains (about 2-3 minutes).

3. Autolyse:
   - Let the shaggy dough rest for 20 minutes. This allows the flour to absorb water fully.

4. Add salt:
   - Sprinkle salt over the dough. Knead it in by folding and pressing for 5 minutes until fully incorporated.

5. Knead:
   - Knead on a clean work surface for 10-15 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and passes the windowpane test (stretch a small piece thin enough to see light through without tearing).
   - The dough should be soft and slightly tacky but not sticky.

6. Bulk fermentation:
   - Shape into a ball and place in a lightly floured bowl.
   - Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel.
   - Let rise at room temperature for 1 hour (dough will not quite double).

7. Divide and shape:
   - Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.
   - Divide into 4 equal portions (approximately 210g each).
   - Shape each portion into a tight, smooth ball by folding edges underneath.

8. Cold fermentation:
   - Place dough balls in a lightly oiled container with space between them, or on a floured tray.
   - Cover tightly with plastic wrap.
   - Refrigerate for 18-24 hours (this is crucial for flavor and texture).

### Day 2: Baking Day

9. Remove from fridge:
   - Take dough balls out 2 hours before baking.
   - Keep covered at room temperature to warm up.

10. Preheat oven:
    - Place pizza stone or steel on the lowest oven rack.
    - Preheat oven to maximum temperature (400-450°C) for at least 15 minutes, longer is better.

11. Prepare sauce:
    - Crush San Marzano tomatoes by hand (remove excess liquid).
    - Add a pinch of salt. Do not cook the sauce.
    - Set aside.

12. Prepare mozzarella:
    - Drain mozzarella well and cut into small pieces or tear by hand.
    - Pat dry with paper towel to remove excess moisture.

13. Shape the pizza:
    - Flour your work surface generously.
    - Take one dough ball and place it in the flour.
    - Press gently with your fingertips from the center outward, leaving a 2cm border untouched for the cornicione (puffy crust edge).
    - Gently stretch by rotating and pulling, letting gravity help.
    - Aim for 3mm thickness in the center, 1-2cm thick edge.
    - Never use a rolling pin - it destroys the air bubbles.

14. Assemble:
    - Transfer dough to a well-floured pizza peel.
    - Spread 3-4 tablespoons of crushed tomato in the center, leaving the edge bare.
    - Distribute mozzarella pieces evenly (don't overload).
    - Drizzle with a thin stream of olive oil.
    - Do **not** add basil yet.

15. Bake:
    - Shake the peel to ensure pizza slides freely.
    - Slide pizza onto the preheated stone/steel.
    - Bake for 3-5 minutes, rotating halfway through if needed.
    - The crust should be puffy, with dark leopard spots, and the bottom should be crisp with char marks.

16. Finish:
    - Remove pizza from oven.
    - Immediately add fresh basil leaves - the heat will wilt them slightly and release their aroma.
    - Drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired.
    - Let rest 1 minute, then serve immediately.

## Key Differences from Standard Recipes

| Element              | Standard Recipe              | Napoli Method                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Yeast amount         | 5g fresh yeast               | 1g fresh yeast (80% less)        |
| Fermentation         | 2h room temp optional cold   | 18-24h cold (mandatory)          |
| Oil in dough         | Often included               | Never                            |
| Basil timing         | Before baking                | After baking                     |
| Baking time          | 7-10 minutes                 | 5-7 minutes (or less with heat)  |
| Sauce                | Sometimes pre-cooked         | Always raw, hand-crushed         |

## Tips for Success

- Hydration: 65% is the sweet spot for home bakers. Experienced bakers can try 70% for an even airier crust.
- Temperature matters: Dough should be room temperature when shaping. Cold dough tears easily.
- Less is more: Authentic Neapolitan is minimalist. Don't overload toppings.
- Flour quality: Tipo 00 is essential. Caputo or Molino Grassi brands are excellent.
- Practice shaping: Your first few pizzas may not be perfect circles. That's normal and adds charm.
- Basil timing: Adding basil after baking keeps it bright green and aromatic instead of blackened.
- Stone/steel is essential: A baking sheet will not get hot enough for proper crust development.

## Timing Overview

Day 1 (30 min active time):
- Mix and knead: 20 min
- Bulk rise: 1 hour
- Shape balls: 10 min
- Refrigerate: 18-24 hours

Day 2 (15 min active per pizza):
- Remove from fridge: 2 hours before
- Preheat oven: 1 hour
- Shape and bake: 10 min per pizza

## Troubleshooting

Dough tears when stretching: 
- Dough is too cold or hasn't rested long enough. Wait 30 more minutes.

Crust doesn't puff:
- Oven not hot enough, or dough was rolled with a pin (destroys air bubbles).

Bottom is pale:
- Stone/steel wasn't preheated long enough. Preheat for 1+ hours.

Toppings are soggy:
- Too much sauce or mozzarella. Use less than you think you need.

Basil is burnt:
- You added it before baking. Always add fresh basil after the pizza comes out of the oven.
