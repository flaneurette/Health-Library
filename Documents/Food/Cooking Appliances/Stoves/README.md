# Why you should switch from gas stoves to induction

Gas stoves have been a kitchen staple for decades, but they come with hidden health and environmental risks. Unlike electric induction cooktops, gas stoves release harmful pollutants directly into your home.

## The hidden dangers of gas stoves

When you cook with gas, the combustion process produces:

- Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) – can irritate the lungs, worsen asthma, and increase the risk of respiratory infections.
- Carbon monoxide (CO) – a colorless, odorless gas that can be deadly in high concentrations.
- Particulate matter (PM) – tiny particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream.
- Formaldehyde – a potential carcinogen released in small amounts during combustion.

Even with proper ventilation, these pollutants can accumulate and affect your health over time. Studies suggest that children living in homes with gas stoves are more likely to experience respiratory problems.

## Why induction is safer

Induction cooktops use electromagnetic fields to heat cookware directly, rather than burning gas. This means:

- No nitrogen dioxide or carbon monoxide emissions.
- Faster and more precise heating.
- Cooler kitchen surfaces (less risk of burns).
- Improved energy efficiency – induction uses less energy than gas or conventional electric stoves.

## How to make the switch

1. Check your cookware – induction requires magnetic cookware (cast iron or stainless steel). You can test with a magnet: if it sticks to the bottom, it works.
2. Choose the right induction cooktop – consider single burners, portable units, or full cooktops depending on your kitchen space.
3. Install safely – most induction cooktops simply need a compatible electrical outlet. For built-in units, a licensed electrician may be required.
4. Adjust your cooking habits – induction heats faster, so lower heat settings are often enough.
5. Dispose of your gas stove responsibly – check local recycling or hazardous waste programs.

Switching from gas to induction isn’t just about convenience – it’s a move towards healthier air, safer cooking, and a more sustainable home.
