# Creating a Healthy Breakfast

A breakfast built around oats, seeds, nuts, fruit, and clean protein is among the healthiest daily choices. It minimizes chemical exposure while maximizing nutrients, steady energy, and long-term metabolic health.

> Many supermarket breads and pastries contain chemicals, binders, emulsifiers and hidden E-numbers that are questionable. Some even have E-numbers that are derived from animals without mentioning it, so vegetarians and vegans are not safe here, and it is also not Kosher or Halal. Some are hidden from the packaging if they are fresh breads or pastries. At the end of this document we show you how to create bread yourself. It is fairly easy.

## Core Principles

A healthy breakfast should:

- Be low in ultra-processed ingredients
- Provide slow-release carbohydrates
- Contain healthy fats
- Include complete or complementary protein
- Support gut health
- Keep you full for several hours

---

## The Foundation

### Oats

> Cleaning: soak them before use to remove any residue, toxins or contaminants. If possible soak with lemon juice or citric acid, overnight, and filter the next day for use.

**Benefits:**
- High in soluble fiber
- Supports gut bacteria
- Helps stabilize blood sugar

**Preparation:**
- Cook with filtered water or unsweetened plant milk
- Simmer 15-25 minutes
- Avoid added sugars

---

### Seeds

Add 1-2 tablespoons of mixed seeds:

- Chia seeds
- Ground flaxseed
- Pumpkin seeds
- Sunflower seeds
- Sesame seeds

**Benefits:**
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Essential minerals
- Improved digestion

---

### Nuts

Use a small handful.

**Good options:**
- Walnuts
- Almonds
- Hazelnuts
- Brazil nuts

**Benefits:**
- Long-lasting energy
- Increased satiety

Prefer raw or dry-roasted, unsalted nuts.

---

### Fruit

Choose whole fruit, not juice.

**Good choices:**
- Blueberries
- Raspberries
- Apple
- Pear
- Banana

**Benefits:**
- Antioxidants
- Fiber
- Natural sweetness

---

### Clean Protein

Protein prevents blood sugar swings and prolongs satiety.

**Options:**
- Greek yogurt or skyr
- Kefir
- Cottage cheese
- Tofu or tempeh
- Minimal-ingredient protein powder

Aim for approximately 20-30 g protein.

# Bread

To treat yourself to homemade bread, here are a few recipes.

Buy **organic flour** where possible.

## Classic French Baguette

Making a classic French baguette at home in a small oven is entirely doable. The key is hydration, kneading, and high-temperature baking. Here's a step-by-step guide that works with an oven that goes up to 230 °C.

### 1. Ingredients (1-2 small baguettes)

- 300 g organic bread flour (or all-purpose flour if needed)
- 200 ml filtered water, lukewarm (~35 °C)
- 5 g dry yeast (or 10 g fresh yeast)
- 1 tsp sea salt
- Optional: 1 tsp honey to feed the yeast

### 2. Step-by-Step Method

#### Step 1: Activate Yeast
- Dissolve yeast (and optional honey) in lukewarm water
- Let sit 5-10 min until foamy

#### Step 2: Mix Dough
- In a bowl, mix flour and salt
- Add yeast water and stir until dough forms

#### Step 3: Knead
- Knead 8-10 min by hand or 5-6 min in a stand mixer until smooth and elastic
- Dough should be slightly sticky - that's normal for baguette

#### Step 4: First Rise (Bulk Fermentation)
- Cover bowl with a clean towel or plastic wrap
- Let rise 1-1.5 hours until doubled in size

#### Step 5: Shape Baguettes
- Gently deflate dough and divide into 1-2 equal pieces
- Roll each piece into a long, thin loaf (~30 cm)
- Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper
- Make 3-5 diagonal slashes on top with a sharp knife or razor

#### Step 6: Second Rise (Proofing)
- Cover loosely with a towel
- Let rise 30-45 min until slightly puffy

#### Step 7: Bake
- Preheat oven to 230 °C
- **Optional:** Place a small oven-safe pan of water at the bottom to create steam → gives a crisp crust
- Bake 20-25 min until golden brown
- Tap the bottom: it should sound hollow

#### Step 8: Cool
- Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing

### 3. Tips for a Perfect Baguette

- **Hydration matters:** Slightly wetter dough gives more open crumb
- **Steam is key:** Creates the shiny, crisp crust French baguettes are known for
- **Don't rush fermentation:** Slow rises (even 2-3 hours for the first rise) improve flavor and digestibility
- **Flour type:** Bread flour gives better gluten development; mix with a little whole wheat if desired for more nutrition

## Sourdough Starter

If you want home sourdough baguettes, here's the simple starter recipe:

### Ingredients:
- 50 g organic flour
- 50 ml filtered water

### Method:
1. Mix flour + water in a small jar
2. Cover loosely, leave at room temp (~20-25 °C)
3. Every 24 h, discard half and feed with 50 g flour + 50 ml water
4. After ~5-7 days, it should be bubbly, slightly sour, and ready to use

### Using Sourdough in Your Baguette
- Replace all or half of the yeast + part of the flour/water with your starter
- Allow longer fermentation for rise and flavor
- Bake as usual at 230 °C, with steam for a crisp crust
