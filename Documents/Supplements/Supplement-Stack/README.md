# Supplement Stack

##### ⚠️ !AVOID TAKING ASPIRIN, WARFARIN OR OTHER BLOOD-THINNING MEDICATION TOGETHER WHILE USING THIS STACK!

##### ⚠️ Warning: This is NOT medical advise. Always consult a medical professional when creating a supplement stack and using it. Science might change, and opinions vary. Some may interact with existing medications. We assume no liability, use at your own risk.

##### ⚠️ More is not always better. i.e. Resveratrol works optimal at 100-250mg. Above it might give you nosebleeds. The same may apply for other vitamins or substances. The list is not conclusive.

### Understanding nutraceutical risks and challenges

"*Despite widespread use and assumed safety, emerging evidence challenges this assumption, revealing potential risks associated with nutraceuticals-particularly at high doses, during prolonged use, or in combination with other bioactive compounds. These risks arise through direct or indirect interactions with cellular systems, which may disrupt homeostasis, trigger oxidative stress, and dysregulate critical molecular pathways that can culminate in organ toxicity or metabolic dysfunction. In the United States, dietary supplements account for approximately 20% of drug-induced liver injuries, with nearly half attributed to combination products, highlighting the need to evaluate nutraceutical safety through the lens of cellular and molecular interactions.*"

## Supplement Use

Good health is about balance-maintaining the body’s equilibrium without overtaxing it. Staying healthy is inherently difficult because it requires a delicate balance: applying just enough stress (such as exercise) to stimulate adaptation, without pushing the body into chronic inflammation.

Supplementation follows the same principle. Supplements can be helpful, but they should be used cautiously to avoid unnecessary toxicity. Eating healthy is important, yet even there we must be mindful of excess exposure to toxins, pesticides, or pathogens. The truth is, we don’t fully understand how to balance all of this perfectly.

The body constantly seeks homeostasis. Introducing a “beneficial” supplement can still disrupt that balance, even if it appears healthy in laboratory settings-curcumin is a good example. For this reason, a good rule of thumb is to use supplements in low doses: less is often better. Avoid prolonged, continuous use, and consider cycling supplements on and off.

The goal of supplementation should be to gently support the body’s natural processes-helping to reduce inflammation, manage free radicals, and assist in clearing senescent cells-not to replace proper nutrition or “structurally feed” the body with supplements.

What we do know is: that caloric restriction and intermitted fasting is very good for our health.

Always consult a medical professional before starting any supplement regimen.

## Cycling Protocol

> ⚠️ Senolytics require caution: do NOT use it prolonged, if possible cycle them as prolonged senolytics use may upset natural balance and **increase** risks. Use the Senolytics in a hit and run. Like cycling it: one month supplements, then a month nothing. Because chronic supplementation might *increase* certain risks.

### A Clean Conceptual Model (not medical advice)

### Month ON

Focus on:
- Resveratrol
- Quercetin
- Fisetin (low dose)
- Luteolin (senomorphic support)

Goal:
- Reduce senescent cell burden
- Calm SASP / inflammation
- "Reset" tissue environment

### Month OFF

Keep:
- Omega-3
- Magnesium
- CoQ10
- Vitamin D
- Vitamin C
- Brewer's yeast

Goal:
- Repair
- Regeneration
- Mitochondrial recovery
- Stem cell support

This mirrors how the body naturally works: clear, rebuild, stabilize.

## Hallmarks of Aging - Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Genomic instability – DNA damage over time

Causes: Radiation, toxins, oxidative stress, replication errors

Prevention/Support:
- Antioxidants (e.g., vitamin C, polyphenols) to reduce oxidative stress
- DNA repair support (NAD⁺ boosters like NMN, NR)
- Avoiding excessive UV and environmental toxins
- Healthy lifestyle (exercise, sleep) to support repair mechanisms

### 2. Telomere attrition – Shortening of chromosome ends

Causes: Cell division, oxidative stress

Prevention/Support:
- Telomerase-activating compounds (TA-65, Astragalus extracts)
- Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory diet
- Regular exercise and stress reduction
- Avoid smoking and chronic infections

### 3. Epigenetic alterations – Changes in gene expression

Causes: Aging, toxins, stress, poor diet

Prevention/Support:
- Caloric restriction or intermittent fasting (modulates epigenetic enzymes)
- Polyphenols (Resveratrol, EGCG)
- Healthy sleep and circadian rhythm maintenance
- Certain supplements affecting methylation (B vitamins, betaine)

### 4. Loss of proteostasis – Misfolded or damaged proteins

Causes: Aging, oxidative stress, cellular damage

Prevention/Support:

- Spermidine supplementation
- Compounds like resveratrol or metformin (in research)

### 11. Chronic inflammation ("inflammaging")

Causes: Persistent immune activation, senescent cells, poor lifestyle

Prevention/Support:
- Anti-inflammatory diet (Mediterranean diet, omega-3s, polyphenols)
- Senolytics to remove pro-inflammatory cells
- Stress management and sleep hygiene
- Avoid smoking and pollutants

### 12. Dysbiosis – Gut microbiome imbalance

Causes: Poor diet, antibiotics, aging

Prevention/Support:
