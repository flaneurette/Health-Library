# Peru balsam (perfume) allergy guide

## What is peru balsam allergy?

Peru balsam allergy is a contact allergy (Type IV hypersensitivity). You're not actually allergic to the tree or its fruits, but to specific chemical compounds found in the resin of the *Myroxylon balsamum* tree.

> Quick advise: avoid all perfume, perfume compounds, additives and skin care products with parfume chemicals.


### Important points:
- It's a contact allergy - works through skin contact, not through eating
- You're allergic to individual chemical compounds that can be found in many products
- These compounds can be synthetic or naturally occurring in other plants
- Affects approximately 5-10% of people with contact allergies

## Main chemical components in peru balsam

### Benzoates & benzyl compounds:
- Benzyl alcohol
- Benzyl benzoate
- Benzyl cinnamate
- Benzoic acid

### Cinnamates:
- Cinnamic acid
- Cinnamyl alcohol
- Cinnamyl cinnamate

### Other components:
- Vanillin (vanilla scent)
- Eugenol (clove oil)
- Isoeugenol
- Farnesol

## Where these substances are found

### Cosmetics & personal care products:
- Perfume/fragrance (almost always!)
- Lip balm, lipstick
- Creams, lotions
- Shampoo, conditioner
- Deodorant, aftershave
- Nail polish, nail polish remover
- Sunscreen (fragranced versions)

### Essential oils & natural fragrances:
- Cinnamon bark oil
- Clove oil
- Ylang-ylang oil
- Citrus oils (bergamot, orange)
- Vanilla extract
- Tolu balsam (similar to peru balsam)

### Household products:
- Fragranced soap
- Laundry detergent, fabric softener
- Air fresheners
- Cleaning products (fragranced)
- Incense, scented candles

### Medical products
- Fragranced bandages
- Some ointments/creams
- Mouthwash (with eugenol)
- Toothpaste (with eugenol/clove)

### Food items (less problematic when eaten):
- Cinnamon
- Vanilla
- Citrus peels
- Cloves
- Some liqueurs and soft drinks

### Other:
- Glue, resin
- Some types of wood
- Cigarettes (added fragrance)
- Propolis (bee resin)

## How to identify on ingredient lists

### Avoid products with:
- "Parfum" or "Fragrance" (without further specification)
- The chemical names mentioned above
- "Balsam of Peru" / "Myroxylon pereirae"
- Essential oils (especially cinnamon, clove, citrus)
- Listed fragrance allergens: Benzyl Alcohol, Geraniol, Linalool, Citral, Limonene

### Look for safe options:
- "Fragrance-free" / "Parfum-free"
- "Hypoallergenic"
- Products specifically for sensitive skin
- "Without essential oils"

Note: Even "natural" and "organic" products can contain peru balsam components through essential oils!

## Why can you eat citrus and cinnamon?

### Type of allergy:
- Peru balsam is a contact allergy - only works through skin contact
- Your immune system reacts to substances penetrating your skin
- Eating doesn't trigger the same immune response

### Concentration and Form:
- In cosmetics: concentrated fragrances that remain on skin for extended periods
- In food: substances are diluted and processed differently by digestion
- Contact vs. ingestion creates different immune responses

### Different Molecules:
- Citric acid is a completely different molecule from aromatic compounds
- Fresh lemon juice contains limonene and citral but in lower concentrations
- Cinnamon can be problematic with intensive skin contact (e.g., cinnamon oil) but not when eaten

## Practical advice: avoiding 80-90% of problems

### The main rule: avoid fragrance

Avoiding fragrance eliminates most of the problem, but also watch for:

1. Essential oils in "natural" products
- Products without synthetic fragrance may still contain essential oils
- Check ingredient lists for: "essential oils", "natural fragrance", plant names + "oil"

2. Specific chemical substances
Sometimes listed separately without "fragrance":
- Benzyl alcohol (also used as preservative, not always problematic in low doses)
- Eugenol (in some toothpastes, mouthwash)
- Vanillin

3. "Unscented" vs "fragrance-free"
- "Unscented" may contain fragrance to mask other scents - avoid!
- "Fragrance-free" or "Parfum-free" is safer

### Look for products with:

- "Fragrance-free" / "Parfum-free"
- "Without essential oils"
- "Hypoallergenic"

### High risk of problems:

- All fragranced products
- "Natural fragrance" products
- Products with long lists of fragrance allergens

### Small risk but be aware:
- Benzyl alcohol in low concentrations (as preservative)
- Toothpaste with clove
- Mouthwash

## What to do if you have a reaction

### Immediate steps:
1. Stop using the product immediately - keep it for ingredient reference
2. Leave the bump/irritation alone - don't pick or scratch
3. Optional: Apply a thin layer of hydrocortisone cream 0.5-1% (available over-the-counter) to the affected area, 1-2 times daily until healed

### Safe alternatives for lip care:
- Pure petroleum jelly or beeswax products
- La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Lèvres (fragrance-free)
- Eucerin lip care (unfragranced versions)
- Bepanthen lip balm
- Products labeled "hypoallergenic" and "fragrance-free"
