# Good lipbalm.

Lips are very sensitive to UV rays and have no natural melanin protection. Always choose a lip balm with UVA and UVB blocking properties (SPF 30+) when possible to protect against sun damage, premature aging, and skin cancer. If possible, avoid chemical sun protection, unperfumed, and use **mineral** based lipbalms to minimize risks.

> Note: "natural" substances does not automatically mean "safe".

> ⚠️ Always check the ingredients of each product, it might contain other substances that you might be allergic too.

## Tips for daily use

1. Apply SPF lip balm before going outside, even on cloudy days
2. Reapply every 2 hours when in direct sun exposure
3. Keep multiple tubes in different locations (bag, desk, car)
4. Check expiration dates - sunscreen ingredients lose effectiveness over time
5. Patch test new products on a small area of lip first if you're unsure

## If you experience a reaction

1. Stop using the product immediately
2. Save the product to check ingredients
3. Apply plain petroleum jelly or hydrocortisone cream 0.5-1%
4. If reaction persists after a week, consult your doctor

Remember: Your lips deserve the same sun protection as your skin!
