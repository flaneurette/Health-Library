# Good lipbalm.

Lips are very sensitive to UV rays and have no natural melanin protection. Always choose a lip balm with UVA and UVB blocking properties (SPF 30+) when possible to protect against sun damage, premature aging, and skin cancer. If possible, avoid chemical sun protection, unperfumed, non-nano, and use **mineral** based lipbalms to minimize risks.

> Note: "natural" substances does not automatically mean "safe".

> ⚠️ Always check the ingredients of each product, it might contain other substances that you might be allergic too.

## DIY SPF30 lip balm

Useful, if you are allergic to most cremes, balms etc.

This is a simple, effective SPF30 lip balm recipe using minimal ingredients: a base, zinc oxide for UV protection, and optional antioxidant.

## Ingredients (for ~15 ml)

```
| Ingredient                                 | Amount    | Function                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------- |
| Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or Cocoa Butter | 8 g       | Base / smooth application   |
| Beeswax (optional for firmness)            | 2 g       | Structure / hardness        |
| Jojoba or Sunflower Oil                    | 2 g       | Extra smoothness            |
| Zinc Oxide (non-nano, powder)              | 3 g       | SPF30 UV filter             |
| Vitamin E                                  | 2-3 drops | Antioxidant, preserves oils |
```

> Tip: 3 g of zinc oxide in 15 ml gives roughly SPF30-35. More zinc oxide increases SPF but reduces spreadability.

### Instructions

1. **Melt the base**

   * Combine petroleum jelly, beeswax, and oil in a heatproof bowl.
   * Melt using a **double boiler** (bowl over simmering water), do not heat directly on flame.

2. **Add antioxidants**

   * Once melted, let the mixture cool slightly (<60°C) and stir in vitamin E.

3. **Add zinc oxide**

   * Slowly add zinc oxide powder while stirring continuously.
   * Ensure a **smooth, uniform mixture without clumps**.

4. **Pour and set**

   * Pour into a small jar or lip balm tube.
   * Let it solidify at room temperature or in the fridge for 10-15 minutes.

5. **Usage**

   * Apply a thin layer to lips.
   * Reapply every 2 hours or after eating/drinking.

### Tips for Best Results

* Use **non-nano zinc oxide** for safe, physical UV protection.
* Avoid adding fragrances to prevent allergic reactions.
* Store in a sealed container at room temperature; shelf life ~6 months.

---

Optional: For ultra-simple sensitive skin version, you can use just **petroleum jelly + zinc oxide + vitamin E**. This eliminates all other ingredients for maximum safety.
