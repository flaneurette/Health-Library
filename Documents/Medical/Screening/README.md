# Lifelong health checklist: screenings & vaccines by age
*Based on CDC, USPSTF, AHA, ACS, and functional medicine guidelines. Customize with your doctor based on risk factors (family history, lifestyle, etc.).*

| Age  | Screening/test               | Frequency               | Why it matters                                                                 | Notes                                                                                     |
|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 18+  | Blood pressure               | Every 2 years (annually if ≥120/80) | Hypertension is silent but damages arteries, heart, and brain.                  | Optimal: <120/80. Lifestyle fixes (DASH diet, exercise) can reverse pre-hypertension.      |
|          | BMI/waist circumference      | Annually                    | Obesity links to diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.                             | Waist >35" (women) or >40" (men) = higher risk, even if BMI is "normal."           |
|          | Chlamydia/gonorrhea           | Annually if sexually active | STIs often asymptomatic but can cause infertility or chronic pain.               | Urine test. CDC recommends up to age 25 (or older if new/risky partners).          |
|          | HIV                           | At least once; more if at risk | 1 in 7 with HIV don’t know they have it.                                          | Rapid finger-prick test. PrEP available for high-risk individuals.              |

|          | Hepatitis B vaccine           | 2-3 doses if unvaccinated   | Hep B is 100x more infectious than HIV; causes liver cancer.                      | Required for healthcare workers.                                                              |
|          | Mental health screening       | Annually                    | Depression/anxiety often missed but treatable.                                   | Tools: PHQ-9 (depression), GAD-7 (anxiety).                                                   |

| 40+  | Mammogram (women)             | Every 1-2 years             | Breast cancer risk increases with age.                                          | Controversial: USPSTF says 50+, but ACS says 40+. Thermography is an option.               |
|          | Colonoscopy                   | Every 10 years (or FIT test annually) | Colon cancer is 90% curable if caught early.                              | FIT test (stool DNA) is non-invasive and effective.                                         |

| 75+  | Colonoscopy decision          | Discuss stopping             | Risks (perforation) may outweigh benefits.                                      | USPSTF says stop at 75 unless high risk.                                                   |
|          | Advance directive review     | Every 5 years or with health changes | Ensures your end-of-life wishes are honored.                              | Specify DNR, DNI, comfort care preferences.                                               |

|          | - NMR lipoprotein test       | Heart disease risk          | Measures LDL particle size (small = dangerous).                                | Standard cholesterol tests miss this.                                                         |
|          | - Gut microbiome test        | Digestive/autoimmune issues | Imbalances link to depression, obesity, and autoimmune disease.                  | Companies: Viome, Thryve.                                                                 |

## How to use this checklist
1. Bookmark it and review at birthdays/annual physicals.
2. Customize with your doctor based on:
   - Family history (e.g., early heart disease, cancer).
   - Lifestyle (e.g., smoking, diet, exercise).
   - Symptoms (e.g., fatigue, digestive issues).
3. Prioritize preventive tests (e.g., CRP, homocysteine, Lp(a))-they’re rarely ordered but predict disease before it starts.
4. Advocate for yourself:
   - *"I’d like to discuss my risk factors for [X]."*
   - *"Are there lifestyle changes I can try before medication?"*
   - *"What’s the evidence behind this test/treatment?"*

---
> Pro tip: Bring this table to your next doctor’s visit and ask:
> *"Which of these screenings do I need based on my health history?"*
>
> Prevention is power. The earlier you catch issues, the easier they are to reverse.
