# Health Prevention Guide

A comprehensive overview of preventive measures for the leading causes of death and daily habits to maximize health and longevity, sorted by most common to least common.

## Leading Causes of Death & Prevention Strategies

### 1. Cardiovascular Disease (Heart attacks, stroke)

- Healthy diet: Plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, moderate salt, and healthy fats
- Regular exercise: 150 minutes per week of moderate activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming)
- Maintain healthy weight and blood pressure: BMI between 18.5-24.9, BP below 120/80 mmHg
- Avoid smoking and limit alcohol: No tobacco products, maximum 1-2 drinks per day
- Regular medical check-ups: Monitor cholesterol (LDL <100 mg/dL), blood pressure, and heart health annually
- Manage stress: Meditation, adequate sleep (7-9 hours), relaxation techniques

### 2. Cancer

- Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol: Leading preventable cause of cancer
- Healthy diet and weight: Plant-based foods, limit red/processed meats
- Sun protection: SPF 30+ sunscreen, avoid tanning beds, protective clothing
- Vaccinations: HPV vaccine (reduces cervical, throat cancers), Hepatitis B vaccine
- Screenings: Mammograms (40+), colonoscopies (45+), Pap smears (21+), prostate checks (50+)  early detection significantly improves survival rates
- Limit exposure to carcinogens: Asbestos, certain chemicals, air pollution, radon

### 3. Respiratory Diseases (COPD, severe infections)

- No smoking: Single most important preventive step for lung health
- Avoid second-hand smoke and air pollutants: Use air purifiers if needed
- Vaccinations: Annual flu shot, COVID-19 boosters, pneumococcal vaccine (65+)
- Exercise: Aerobic activity strengthens lungs and immune system
- Prompt treatment of infections: Don't delay treatment for persistent coughs or breathing issues

### 4. Neurological Diseases (Alzheimer's, dementia)

- Healthy diet: Mediterranean or MIND diet linked to 30-35% lower dementia risk
- Regular exercise: Both aerobic and strength training protect brain health
- Brain activity: Puzzles, reading, learning new skills, social engagement
- Manage cardiovascular risk factors: Blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol all affect brain health
- Avoid smoking and excess alcohol: Both accelerate cognitive decline
- Quality sleep: 7-9 hours nightly; chronic sleep deprivation linked to increased dementia risk
- Protect your head: Wear helmets, prevent falls

### 5. Accidents / Unintentional Injuries

- Drive safely: Seatbelts always, no texting/drinking while driving, obey speed limits
- Home safety: Non-slip mats, adequate lighting, smoke/CO detectors, secure rugs
- Workplace safety: Proper protective equipment, follow training protocols
- Water safety: Learn to swim, life jackets on boats, supervise children
- Fall prevention: Balance exercises (especially 65+), proper footwear, remove tripping hazards
- Medication safety: Store properly, follow dosing instructions

### 6. Infections / Sepsis

- Hand hygiene: Wash hands frequently with soap for 20+ seconds
- Vaccinations: Stay current on recommended vaccines for your age
- Prompt treatment: Seek medical care for worsening infections
- Wound care: Clean cuts/wounds properly, watch for signs of infection
- Healthy immune system: Adequate sleep, balanced nutrition, moderate stress, regular exercise

### 7. Metabolic / Diabetes-related Deaths

- Healthy diet: Low in refined sugars and processed foods, high in fiber
- Weight control: Even 5-10% weight loss significantly reduces diabetes risk
- Regular exercise: 150 minutes weekly; improves insulin sensitivity
- Monitor blood sugar: Regular screening if at risk (family history, overweight, age 45+)
- Regular checkups: HbA1c testing catches pre-diabetes early

### 8. Liver Disease

- Limit alcohol consumption: No more than 1-2 drinks per day; consider alcohol-free days
- Vaccinations: Hepatitis A and B vaccines if at risk
- Healthy weight: Prevents non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
- Avoid hepatotoxic substances: Limit unnecessary medications, avoid mixing alcohol with medications
- Safe practices: Avoid sharing needles, practice safe sex

## General Cross-Cutting Measures

- Quality sleep: 7-9 hours nightly supports all body systems and recovery
- Stress management: Chronic stress contributes to heart disease, metabolic issues, and mental health problems
- Regular medical checkups: Early detection often determines treatment success
- Social connections: Strong relationships linked to increased longevity and better mental health
- Stay hydrated: 8-10 cups of water daily supports all organ systems
- Limit environmental toxins: Use natural cleaning products, avoid excessive plastic exposure

## Top 10 Daily Habits to Maximize Health & Survival

### 1. Move Your Body
At least 30 minutes of moderate activity daily (walking, cycling, stretching, strength training). Supports cardiovascular health, lung function, muscle strength, bone density, and cognitive function.

### 2. Eat Mostly Whole, Balanced Foods
Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, avocados), lean protein. Limit added sugar, processed foods, and excess salt. Aim for colorful variety.

### 3. Maintain a Healthy Weight
Weight management reduces risks of heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, and many cancers. Focus on sustainable habits rather than crash diets.

### 4. Avoid Smoking & Limit Alcohol
No smoking, vaping, or excessive drinking. Reduces risk of heart disease, lung disease, cancer, liver disease, and cognitive decline.

### 5. Protect Yourself from Infections
Wash hands regularly (especially before eating), properly clean and cover wounds, keep vaccinations up to date. Treat infections early to prevent complications like sepsis.

### 6. Prioritize Sleep
7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly. Sleep regulates heart health, metabolism, immunity, hormone balance, and cognitive function. Maintain consistent sleep schedule.

### 7. Manage Stress & Emotions
Practice meditation, breathing exercises, engage in hobbies, maintain social connections. Chronic stress contributes to heart disease, metabolic problems, weakened immunity, and cognitive decline.

### 8. Regular Medical Checkups & Screenings
Monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and get age-appropriate cancer screenings. Dental checkups twice yearly. Early detection dramatically improves treatment outcomes.

### 9. Stay Mentally & Socially Engaged
Learn new things, maintain social interactions, do puzzles or brain games, pursue creative hobbies. Protects against cognitive decline and supports mental wellbeing.

### 10. Practice Safety Daily
Buckle seatbelts, eliminate home hazards, use proper protective gear for work or sports, be cautious with heights or slippery surfaces. Prevents accidents  a leading cause of premature death, especially under age 50.

## Key Takeaway

Following these habits doesn't guarantee immortality, but it dramatically reduces the risk of almost all common causes of death and supports both physical and mental resilience. Most causes of death are preventable or modifiable through lifestyle choices, awareness, and regular medical care.

Small, consistent actions compound over time to create significant health benefits and increased longevity.
