# Vaccination Priority Guide for Adults Over 48

Based on your table, here's a prioritized approach:

## Tier 1: Get These Soon 

Td/Tdap (Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis)
- Every 10 years throughout life
- Critical for wound protection (cuts, punctures, gardening injuries)
- Inexpensive and widely available
- *Action: Check when you last had one; get booster if it's been 10+ years*

Annual Influenza Shot
- Each fall/winter season
- Reduces risk of severe complications that increase with age
- Free or low-cost in most settings
- *Action: Get annually in autumn*

COVID-19
- Follow current booster recommendations (typically annual or as advised)
- Prevents severe disease and hospitalization
- *Action: Stay current with local health authority guidance*

## Tier 2: Strongly Consider Now

HPV Vaccine (2 doses, ~€250)
- FDA/EMA approved through age 45
- Prevents HPV-related cancers (throat, genital) and genital warts
- Most effective before exposure, but still beneficial at 48
- Worth discussing with your doctor, especially if you're in a new relationship or have limited prior HPV exposure
- *Action: Consult your GP about whether this makes sense for your situation*

## Tier 3: Plan for Soon (Age 50+)

Shingles Vaccine (2 doses, ~€400)
- Officially recommended at 50+, though sometimes given earlier
- Prevents painful shingles and chronic nerve pain (postherpetic neuralgia)
- Risk increases significantly after 50
- *Action: Schedule for when you turn 50, or ask your doctor if earlier makes sense given your health*

## Tier 4: Check Your Status

MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)
- *Action: If you're unsure about childhood vaccination, get a blood titer test to check immunity*
- Only need vaccination if blood test shows you're not immune

Hepatitis B
- *Action: Check if you completed the childhood series*
- Important if you work in healthcare, travel frequently, or have other risk factors

Next Steps:
1. Schedule Td/Tdap if due (check your records)
2. Get your annual flu shot this fall
3. Confirm COVID-19 booster status
4. Discuss HPV with your doctor at next visit
5. Mark your calendar for shingles vaccine at age 50
