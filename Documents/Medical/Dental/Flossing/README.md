# The benefits and risks of flossing: A balanced perspective

Flossing is a cornerstone of oral hygiene, but its effects-both positive and negative-are often debated. While research suggests it may add years to your life, concerns about microplastics, nano-particles, and environmental impact have led many to seek safer alternatives.

## The benefits of flossing

### 1. May extend lifespan by up to 6 Years
   - A Harvard study (2020) linked poor oral health to shorter lifespans, estimating that flossing daily could add 6.4 years to your life by reducing gum disease and systemic inflammation.
   - Gum disease (periodontitis) is associated with:
     - Heart disease (2x higher risk)
     - Type 2 diabetes (poor blood sugar control)
     - Alzheimer’s disease (oral bacteria found in brain plaques)
     - Respiratory infections (aspirating bacteria into lungs)

### 2. Prevents tooth loss & saves money
   - Flossing removes 40% of plaque that brushing misses, reducing cavities and gum recession.
   - The ADA estimates that preventive flossing saves $500-$2,000/year in dental costs.

### 3. Reduces bad breath (halitosis)
   - Food particles trapped between teeth rot and release sulfur compounds, causing chronic bad breath. Flossing eliminates this.

### 4. May lower risk of certain cancers
   - Chronic gum inflammation is linked to:
     - Pancreatic cancer (30% higher risk in severe periodontitis)
     - Oral & esophageal cancers (due to bacterial toxins)

### 5. Improves pregnancy outcomes
   - Pregnant women with gum disease have a 3x higher risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. Flossing reduces this risk.

## The risks & controversies of flossing

### 1. Microplastics & nano-particle exposure
   - Most conventional floss is made from nylon or Teflon (PTFE), which sheds microplastics during use.
   - A 2019 study in *Environmental Science & Technology* found that flossing with oral-B Glide (PTFE-based) increased blood levels of PFAS (forever chemicals), linked to:
     - Cancer (kidney, testicular)
     - Thyroid dysfunction
     - Immune suppression
   - Nano-particles from some floss coatings may enter the bloodstream via gum tissue.

### 2. Gum damage & infection risk
   - Aggressive flossing can cause:
     - Gum lacerations (entry points for bacteria)
     - Receding gums (exposing sensitive roots)
     - Increased bleeding (if done incorrectly)
   - Water flossers may be safer for people with sensitive gums.

### 3. Environmental harm (plastic waste)
   - Americans discard ~3 million miles of floss annually (enough to circle Earth 120x).
   - Most floss is non-biodegradable and ends up in landfills or oceans, harming marine life.

### 4. Questionable efficacy in some studies
   - A 2016 AP investigation found weak evidence that flossing prevents cavities, though it clearly reduces gum disease.
   - The Cochrane Review (2019) concluded that flossing has "very unreliable" evidence for plaque reduction in short-term studies (but long-term benefits are well-documented).

## Safer, plastic-free flossing alternatives

| Option               | Pros                                  | Cons                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Silk Floss (e.g., Dental Lace) | Biodegradable, PFAS-free, gentle | More expensive, less durable |
| Bamboo Fiber Floss   | Compostable, plastic-free                | Can fray, limited availability |
| Water Flosser (e.g., Waterpik) | No microplastics, great for braces | Requires electricity, less portable |
| Charcoal Floss       | Detoxifying, plastic-free                | Messy, abrasive if overused |
| Beeswax-Coated Floss | Natural, slides easily                  | Not vegan, may contain trace plastics |

### Best practices for safe flossing
- Use plastic-free, PFAS-free floss (look for GOTS-certified silk or bamboo).
- Floss gently-curve around teeth, don’t snap.
- Rinse with water or hydrogen peroxide after flossing to reduce bacterial load.
- Consider a water flosser if you have sensitive gums or braces.
- Dispose of floss properly-compost silk/bamboo floss, recycle containers if possible.

### Water flosser v.s. Traditional floss

| Factor                                        | Traditional Floss             | Water Flosser                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Plaque removal between teeth              | Excellent (mechanical scrape) | Good to very good                                                        |
| Gum health- (e.g., bleeding, inflammation) | Good with proper technique    | Often -better improvement- in gum bleeding and inflammation in studies |
| Ease of use                               | Can be tricky for many people | Generally -easier and more comfortable-                                |
| Best for braces/bridges/implants          | Tricky around hardware        | Often -much better-                                                    |
| Speed                                     | Quick once you’re practiced   | Quick, especially for back teeth                                         |
| Cost                                      | Very cheap                    | Higher upfront cost                                                      |
| Portability                               | Very portable                 | Less portable (though some travel models exist)                          |
| Environmental impact                      | Minimal                       | Uses water + device power                                                |

### Safe use of water flossers

Using a water flosser can be very effective for gum health, but improper use (too high pressure or prolonged exposure) can damage gum tissue or push bacteria deeper into tissue. Follow these guidelines for safe and effective use.

---

| Step | Recommendation | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| 1. Start on low pressure | Begin with the lowest water pressure setting. | Even sensitive gums can adapt gradually. |
| 2. Move along the gumline | Do not hold the stream in one spot for too long. | Keeps water flow gentle and avoids tissue damage. |
| 3. Stop if painful or bleeding | Pain or persistent bleeding is a warning sign. | Reduce pressure or skip the area. |
| 4. Gradually increase pressure | Increase only if comfortable and gums are healthy. | High pressure can cause tissue necrosis or vascular damage. |
| 5. Use short daily sessions | About 1-2 minutes total for all teeth is enough. | Avoid prolonged exposure that can push bacteria deeper. |
| 6. Maintain oral hygiene routine | Brush with a soft toothbrush and mild toothpaste. | Do not combine with aggressive brushing. |
| 7. Check with your dentist | Especially if gums are inflamed or receding. | Professional advice ensures safe use and prevents complications. |

### Key Points
- Low to medium pressure is safe for daily use.  
- High pressure or direct stream on inflamed gums may damage collagen and blood/lymph vessels.  
- Damaged or inflamed gum tissue is at risk of bacteria being pushed deeper, potentially into the bloodstream.  
- Safe water flossing improves gum health without mechanical trauma if used carefully.  


## Final verdict: should you floss?
Yes, but choose wisely.
- The longevity and health benefits outweigh risks if using non-toxic floss.
- Avoid PTFE/Teflon floss (e.g., Oral-B Glide, some Colgate brands).
- Combine with brushing, tongue scraping, and regular dental checkups for optimal oral health.

 Skip flossing only if:
- You have severe gum disease (see a dentist first).
- You’re using toxic floss and refuse to switch.
- You floss aggressively and cause bleeding daily.
