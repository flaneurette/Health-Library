# The benefits and risks of flossing: A balanced perspective

Flossing is a cornerstone of oral hygiene, but its effects-both positive and negative-are often debated. While research suggests it may add years to your life, concerns about microplastics, nano-particles, and environmental impact have led many to seek safer alternatives.

> Pro Tip: If you’re unsure, ask your dentist for PFAS-free, biodegradable floss recommendations tailored to your gum health!

## The benefits of flossing

### 1. May extend lifespan by up to 6 Years
   - A Harvard study (2020) linked poor oral health to shorter lifespans, estimating that flossing daily could add 6.4 years to your life by reducing gum disease and systemic inflammation.
   - Gum disease (periodontitis) is associated with:
     - Heart disease (2x higher risk)
     - Type 2 diabetes (poor blood sugar control)
     - Alzheimer’s disease (oral bacteria found in brain plaques)
     - Respiratory infections (aspirating bacteria into lungs)

### 2. Prevents tooth loss & saves money
   - Flossing removes 40% of plaque that brushing misses, reducing cavities and gum recession.
   - The ADA estimates that preventive flossing saves $500–$2,000/year in dental costs.

### 3. Reduces bad breath (halitosis)
   - Food particles trapped between teeth rot and release sulfur compounds, causing chronic bad breath. Flossing eliminates this.

### 4. May lower risk of certain cancers
   - Chronic gum inflammation is linked to:
     - Pancreatic cancer (30% higher risk in severe periodontitis)
     - Oral & esophageal cancers (due to bacterial toxins)

### 5. Improves pregnancy outcomes
   - Pregnant women with gum disease have a 3x higher risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. Flossing reduces this risk.

## The risks & controversies of flossing

### 1. Microplastics & nano-particle exposure
   - Most conventional floss is made from nylon or Teflon (PTFE), which sheds microplastics during use.
   - A 2019 study in *Environmental Science & Technology* found that flossing with oral-B Glide (PTFE-based) increased blood levels of PFAS (forever chemicals), linked to:
     - Cancer (kidney, testicular)
     - Thyroid dysfunction
     - Immune suppression
   - Nano-particles from some floss coatings may enter the bloodstream via gum tissue.

### 2. Gum damage & infection risk
   - Aggressive flossing can cause:
     - Gum lacerations (entry points for bacteria)
     - Receding gums (exposing sensitive roots)
     - Increased bleeding (if done incorrectly)
   - Water flossers may be safer for people with sensitive gums.

### 3. Environmental harm (plastic waste)
   - Americans discard ~3 million miles of floss annually (enough to circle Earth 120x).
   - Most floss is non-biodegradable and ends up in landfills or oceans, harming marine life.

### 4. Questionable efficacy in some studies
   - A 2016 AP investigation found weak evidence that flossing prevents cavities, though it clearly reduces gum disease.
   - The Cochrane Review (2019) concluded that flossing has "very unreliable" evidence for plaque reduction in short-term studies (but long-term benefits are well-documented).

## Safer, plastic-free flossing alternatives

| Option               | Pros                                  | Cons                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Silk Floss (e.g., Dental Lace) | Biodegradable, PFAS-free, gentle | More expensive, less durable |
| Bamboo Fiber Floss   | Compostable, plastic-free                | Can fray, limited availability |
| Water Flosser (e.g., Waterpik) | No microplastics, great for braces | Requires electricity, less portable |
| Charcoal Floss       | Detoxifying, plastic-free                | Messy, abrasive if overused |
| Beeswax-Coated Floss | Natural, slides easily                  | Not vegan, may contain trace plastics |

### Best practices for safe flossing
- Use plastic-free, PFAS-free floss (look for GOTS-certified silk or bamboo).
- Floss gently-curve around teeth, don’t snap.
- Rinse with water or hydrogen peroxide after flossing to reduce bacterial load.
- Consider a water flosser if you have sensitive gums or braces.
- Dispose of floss properly-compost silk/bamboo floss, recycle containers if possible.

### Water flosser v.s. Traditional floss

| Factor                                        | Traditional Floss             | Water Flosser                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Plaque removal between teeth              | Excellent (mechanical scrape) | Good to very good                                                        |
| Gum health- (e.g., bleeding, inflammation) | Good with proper technique    | Often -better improvement- in gum bleeding and inflammation in studies |
| Ease of use                               | Can be tricky for many people | Generally -easier and more comfortable-                                |
| Best for braces/bridges/implants          | Tricky around hardware        | Often -much better-                                                    |

| Cost                                      | Very cheap                    | Higher upfront cost                                                      |
| Portability                               | Very portable                 | Less portable (though some travel models exist)                          |
| Environmental impact                      | Minimal                       | Uses water + device power                                                |

## Final verdict: should you floss?
Yes, but choose wisely.
- The longevity and health benefits outweigh risks if using non-toxic floss.
- Avoid PTFE/Teflon floss (e.g., Oral-B Glide, some Colgate brands).
- Combine with brushing, tongue scraping, and regular dental checkups for optimal oral health.

 Skip flossing only if:
- You have severe gum disease (see a dentist first).
- You’re using toxic floss and refuse to switch.
- You floss aggressively and cause bleeding daily.
