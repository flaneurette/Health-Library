# ORS

ORS stands for Oral Rehydration Solution. It's a simple, life-saving mixture used to treat dehydration, especially from diarrhea, vomiting, or heat-related illness. It replaces water, salts, and sugar in the right proportions so the body can absorb them efficiently.

### How it works

* Sugar (glucose) - helps the intestines absorb sodium and water
* Sodium (salt) - restores electrolytes
* Water - prevents dehydration
* Potassium (sometimes added) - helps muscles and heart function

This combination is much more effective than water alone, because water with sugar and salt allows your intestines to reabsorb fluids instead of losing them.

### Standard WHO ORS recipe (for 1 liter of water)

Ingredients:

* 1 liter clean water
* 6 teaspoons sugar (≈ 30 g)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (≈ 3 g)

Instructions:

1. Mix everything until fully dissolved.
2. Taste should be slightly sweet, not salty - if it tastes too salty, add more water.
3. Drink in small sips throughout the day.

Optional: Add a small amount of potassium (like banana mash) if available - it helps maintain heart and muscle function.

### Key points

* Clean water is critical - unsafe water can make dehydration worse.
* Do not over-salt - too much salt can cause hypernatremia, which is dangerous.
* Works for children and adults.
* Can be used in emergencies until real food is available.

### Emergency ORS Recipe (makes ~1 liter)

Ingredients:

* 1 liter clean water
* 6 teaspoons sugar (≈ 30 g)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (≈ 3 g)

Instructions:

1. Boil water if possible, or use the cleanest water available. Let it cool.
2. Add the sugar and salt.
3. Stir until fully dissolved.
4. Taste: it should be slightly sweet, not salty. If it tastes too salty, add a little more water.
5. Sip throughout the day, don't chug. Small frequent sips are best.

### Survival tips

* Keep hydrated - even a little water is better than nothing.
* Do not add extra salt - too much can be dangerous.
* Rest and conserve energy - your body burns fewer electrolytes when you're not active.
* If any other foods appear, prioritize: protein - potassium - fats.

Alright, let's break it down carefully. We'll estimate how long a person could survive on just sugar, salt, water, basically using a crude ORS setup. I'll go step by step.

---

### 1. Calories from sugar

* 1 teaspoon of sugar ≈ 4 grams ≈ 16 kcal
* 6 teaspoons per liter = 24 g sugar ≈ 96 kcal per liter

Let's say you drink 2 liters/day (which is reasonable for survival):

* 96 kcal x 2 = 192 kcal/day

Reality check: the human body needs roughly 1,500–2,000 kcal/day minimum to survive without body fat, just to keep organs alive.

* 192 kcal/day is very low - body will burn fat first, then muscle/protein.

---

### 2. Salt intake

* 1/2 teaspoon per liter = 3 g sodium chloride
* 2 liters/day - 6 g salt/day

That's within survivable limits. The body won't die of salt overload at this level; it's basically replacing lost electrolytes.

---

### 3. Water

* 2 liters/day of ORS keeps you hydrated if you're not sweating excessively.

Dehydration is the fastest killer; water + ORS solves that.

### 4. What's still missing

Even with sugar, salt, and water:

* Protein deficiency - muscles, immune system, organs get broken down
* Fat deficiency - hormones, energy for long-term survival
* Micronutrients missing - vitamins (C, B12, etc.), potassium, magnesium

Result: your body starts cannibalizing itself after a few days.

---

### 5. Rough survival estimate

* 0–3 days: fully functional
* 3–7 days: extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, dizziness
* 1–2 weeks: serious muscle loss, immune suppression, risk of infections
* 2–4 weeks: organ failure risk rises; death becomes likely without additional nutrients

Note: If you have body fat, you can survive slightly longer (fat can be burned for energy, but protein is still essential).
