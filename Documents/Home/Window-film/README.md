# Mounting UV film.

This guide is for transparent GSW window film/foil, with adhesive layer. Blocks 99% of UV rays, up to 385nm, to create flawless window film without bubbles or air pockets.

> TIP: use a small piece and try it out on a test window.

> TIP: start on a less obvious window, so you can practice.

# Tools used.

1. Reverse osmosis filtered water (or sterile water): 3 Liters. (prevents minereal streaks)
2. Dreft/fairy dishwash soap.
3. Wooden or plastic ruler. 30CM. (I used plastic)
4. Small breakable stanley knife.
5. Small 10cm squeegee with felt or velvet tip (very important)
6. Painters non-sticky tape.
7. Microfiber cloth.
8. Sponge.
9. Razor window scraper
10. Rubber window squeegee (20cm)
11. 99% alcohol
12. Kitchen paper

# Steps


#### 1. Clean

Make a spray bottle with 1 liter water with 2 drops of dreft/fairy dishwash soap.

1. Spray window generously with mixture.
2. Use razor to removes debris, plastic, glue, tape, etc. Work in sections and cover entire window.
3. Use sponge to clean.
4. Then use window rubber window squeegee to clean, from top to bottom.

#### 2. Desinfect

1. Pour some alcohol on microfiber cloth/kitchen paper, rub entire window or spots (usually tape or glue spots)
2. Use razor again to removes debris, plastic, glue, tape, etc. Work in sections and cover entire window.
3. Pour some alcohol on microfiber cloth, rub entire window or spots (usually tape or glue spots)

Let it dry few minutes, not too long: dust might settle!

#### 3. Prepare & Place

1. Spray window generously with mixture.
2. Keep the foil/film in the box. 
3. Place the box below the window.
4. Get a ladder and raise the foil from the box.
5. Peel a corner slowly: 15-20cm
6. Quickly spray it with mixture.
7. Peel other corner slowly: 15-20cm
8. Quickly spray it with mixture.
9. Place 25cm of foil length on the top part of the window (should stick)
10. Spray outside foil with mixture.
11. Then use ruler to softly move 25cm down, few bubbles should remain (2 passes)
12. Peel another 15-20cm slowly.
13. Lift foil, and spray the adhesive on backside (move between foil and window, very important)
14. Spray outside foil with mixture.
15. Then use ruler to softly move 25cm down, few bubbles should remain (2 passes)
16. Peel another 15-20cm slowly.
17. Lift foil, and spray the adhesive on backside (move between foil and window, very important)

Repeat 10-12 until all foil is placed. Remember: everything should be as wet as possible.

#### 4. Cut/Trim

1. Quickly, with a breakable stanley knife and ruler, place ruler on corner -before the caulking- and cut 1-3mm from the caulking. Keep 1-3mm free from panes/caulking.
2. Do this on all sides.

#### 5. Bubble removal

It's now important to remove 98% of all bubbles. Small bubbles will evaporate, you can't get it 100%.

0. Spray foil with mixture.
1. Grab small 10cm squeegee with **felt or velvet tip** (very important)
2. From the top, slowly move down the window foil by pressing on the foil. (not too hard, not too little) the felt should not make scratches nor streaks.
3. If you hear crackling sound, you were too slow and adhesive is drying! you cannot fix this. Start over!
4. Continue from top to bottom, pressing a bit harder.
5. At the bottom, press bit harder to remove pools/large bubbles.
6. Do this until 98% of bubbles are gone.

#### 6. Finalize

Let it dry for at least 72 hours.

In 3 weeks, depending on heat, you could check for bubbles. Some bubbles can be scored with a needle: just punch a hole in it. Hoever, if you rub the water out, the glue might leave white streaks! it's best to let the bubbles disolve naturally, which could take months.

Cleaning: with dishwash soap. No ammonia.
