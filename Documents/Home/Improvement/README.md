## Health, Energy & Climate Control (Lower Bills + More Comfort)

### 0) UV blocking window film (clear film, not tinted)

* Blocks 99% of UV rays. No indoor tanning, no UV fading of objects and less risk of early wrinkels and skin cancer. Window film can last up to 20 years. Top tier improvement. 

### 1) Thermal Curtains

* Adds insulation in winter and blocks heat in summer (cuts heating/cooling costs).

### 2) Door Draft Stoppers / Weatherstripping

* Simple foam/brush strips that seal gaps under doors and windows.
* Reduces heat loss and cold drafts in winter.

### 3) Programmable / Smart Thermostat

* Automatically lowers heating/cooling when you’re away or asleep.
* Saves significant energy overtime.

### 4) Reflective Roof Coating / Attic Insulation

* A cool roof coating reflects heat in summer.
* Proper attic insulation drastically reduces both heating and cooling needs.

## Air Quality & Health (Better Breathing, Lower Allergies)

### 5) High-Quality Air Filters (HEPA)

* For HVAC or portable air purifiers - reduces dust, pollen, smoke.
* Replace regularly to keep efficiency high.

### 6) Ventilation Fans / Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRV)

* Removes stale air and replaces it with fresh air while retaining heat.
* Great for airtight homes.

### 7) Dehumidifier / Humidifier

* Keeps indoor humidity in the healthy zone (40-60%).
* Prevents mold growth and respiratory irritation.
