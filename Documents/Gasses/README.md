# Gases and Risks

Because of the severity and risks of gases, and to prevent confusion, **each gas has its own file you can read**. Open the corresponding file for a type of gas to learn more about it.

## General Risks

**Remember:** most gases **cannot be seen, smelled, tasted, or heard**. They can accumulate quickly and become deadly even in small amounts.  

If you can smell a gas, it usually means the manufacturer has added a warning substance.  

**Be extra careful:**  
- Cooking on charcoal or an open fire can produce **carbon monoxide (CO)**, which **cannot be detected without special detectors**.  
- **Cooking indoors should always be done on electrical induction if possible. NEVER use open flames indoors.**
