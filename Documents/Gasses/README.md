# Gases and Risks

Because of the severity and risks of gases, and to prevent confusion, **each gas has its own file you can read**. Open the corresponding file for a type of gas to learn more about it.

## General Risks

**Remember:** most gases **cannot be seen, smelled, tasted, or heard**. They can accumulate quickly and become deadly even in small amounts.  

If you can smell a gas, it usually means the manufacturer has added a warning substance.  

**Be extra careful:**  
- Cooking on charcoal or an open fire can produce **carbon monoxide (CO)**, which **cannot be detected without special detectors**.  
- **Cooking indoors should always be done on electrical induction if possible. NEVER use open flames indoors.**

## Gas Types

### 1. Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Produced by incomplete combustion (charcoal, gas stoves, fireplaces).  
- Colorless, odorless, and highly toxic.  

### 2. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) 
- Produced by gas stoves, heaters, and vehicle exhaust.  
- Can irritate the lungs and worsen asthma.  

### 3. Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)
- Naturally present in the air but can accumulate in enclosed spaces.  
- High concentrations can cause dizziness, headaches, or suffocation.  

### 4. Methane (CH₄)
- Main component of natural gas.  
- Highly flammable and can form explosive mixtures with air.  

### 5. Propane (C₃H₈)
- Commonly used for heating and cooking.  
- Flammable and can cause asphyxiation in confined spaces.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Always use proper ventilation, detectors, and induction cooking whenever possible. Avoid open flames indoors.
